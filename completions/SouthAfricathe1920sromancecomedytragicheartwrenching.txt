The film opens with a shot of the African landscape, with the sun setting in the distance. We hear a voiceover from the protagonist, a young woman named Naledi, as she talks about her life growing up in a small village in South Africa. She talks about her parents, who were killed in a tribal conflict when she was a child, and how she was raised by her grandparents. Naledi talks about how she always dreamed of leaving her village and seeing the world, but never thought it would be possible.

One day, Naledi's grandparents receive a letter from a woman in Johannesburg, who is looking for a maid to come and work for her. Naledi's grandparents agree to let her go, and Naledi sets off on the journey to the city.

When Naledi arrives in Johannesburg, she is taken in by the woman who wrote the letter, Mrs. Masandi. Mrs. Masandi is a wealthy widow, who lives in a large mansion with her two sons, Thabo and Sizwe.

 Naledi quickly adjusts to life in the city, and enjoys working for Mrs. Masandi. She is also attracted to Thabo, who is Mrs. Masandi's oldest son. Thabo is a bit of a playboy, and is known for his many affairs with married women. However, he takes a liking to Naledi, and the two begin a secret affair.

Naledi is happy in her new life, and is content to be Thabo's mistress. However, she is unaware that Thabo is only using her to get to her grandmother's land, which he wants to buy for a mining project.

When Naledi's grandmother falls ill, she goes back to the village to see her. While she is there, she finds out about Thabo's plans, and also learns that her grandparents are in debt and may lose their land. Naledi is heartbroken, and decides to return to Johannesburg to confront Thabo.

When Naledi returns to Johannesburg, she tells Thabo that she knows about his plans, and breaks off their relationship. Thabo is angry, and tries to convince Naledi to stay with him, but she refuses.

Naledi goes back to work for Mrs. Masandi, but is unhappy. One day, she is fired after Mrs. Masandi finds out about her affair with Thabo. Naledi is devastated, and decides to leave Johannesburg.

As she is packing her things, Sizwe, Mrs. Masandi's younger son, comes to her and tells her that he is in love with her. Naledi is surprised, but decides to stay and give Sizwe a chance.

The two begin a relationship, and Naledi is happy once again. However, she is still haunted by her memories of Thabo, and she is unsure if she can truly trust Sizwe.

The film ends with Naledi and Sizwe getting married, and Naledi finally finding happiness.
