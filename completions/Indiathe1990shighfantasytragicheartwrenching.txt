The film opens with a scene of immense natural beauty; a vast and verdant forest, teeming with life. Suddenly, this idyll is shattered by the sound of blades ringing out, as a band of warriors descend upon the peaceful scene.

The warriors are ruthless and efficient, slaughtering anyone they encounter. Among their victims is a young boy, who clings to life despite being grievously wounded. The boy is found by a woman who takes him in and nurses him back to health.

The boy, who is named Arjun, grows up to be a strong and courageous young man. He falls in love with a beautiful girl named Leela. Arjun and Leela have a happy life together, until the day that the band of warriors return.

Arjun is away from home when the warriors attack, but he rushes back to find his loved ones killed. Devastated, Arjun sets out on a quest for vengeance. He track down the warriors one by one, killing them all in brutal fashion.

 Along the way, Arjun discovers that the band of warriors were actually sent by a shadowy organization known as the Dark Lords. The Dark Lords are a group of powerful sorcerers who rule the land with an iron fist.

Arjun eventually confronts the Dark Lords, but he is outnumbered and outmatched. Just when all hope seems lost, Leela appears, alive and well. It turns out that she was hidden away by Arjun's mother before the attack.
