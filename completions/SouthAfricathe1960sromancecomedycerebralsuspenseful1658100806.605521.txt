In the early 1960s, after the end of apartheid in South Africa, a young white woman named Julia falls in love with a black man named Isaac. Despite the social taboo against their relationship, they decide to get married. However, Julia's father, a racist and bigoted man, disapproves of their relationship and does everything in his power to prevent them from getting married.

 Julia and Isaac are undeterred, and with the help of their friends, they secretly plan their wedding. On the day of the wedding, Julia's father finds out about the plans and races to the ceremony to stop it from happening. However, he arrives too late and Julia and Isaac are married.

Enraged, Julia's father disowns her and she is cut off from her family. Julia and Isaac try to make the best of their situation, but the racism and bigotry they face from both white and black people make it difficult. They eventually decide to leave South Africa and move to England, where they hope to start a new life together.
