As the body count rises, the police come to realise that they are dealing with a serial killer. But with no leads and no witnesses, they are struggling to solve the case.

Then, one of the detectives, a woman namedRani Singh, begins to piece together the clues. She comes to realise that the murders are connected to a powerful politician, a man who has a history of violence against women.

Rani races to track down the killer before he can strike again. But as she gets closer to the truth, she realise that she is also being watched... and that she may be the next target.

The story comes to a tense and suspenseful climax as Rani faces off against the killer. She must use all her skills and ingenuity to solve the case and bring the murderer to justice.
