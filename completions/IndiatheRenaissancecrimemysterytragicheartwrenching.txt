The film opens with a shot of the Taj Mahal, one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. We then cut to a rowing boat on the river Ganges, filled with tourists who are taking photos and enjoying the scenery. However, there is one passenger who is not enjoying the view.

Shah Jahan, the Mughal Emperor, is on his way to visit the grave of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. He is clearly heartbroken and withdrawn, and his attendants are worried about him.

When Shah Jahan arrives at the Taj Mahal, he is overcome with emotion. He remembers the happy times he spent with Mumtaz, and how she died in childbirth just a few months after their wedding.

Shah Jahan believes that Mumtaz's ghost is haunting him, and he becomes increasingly paranoid. He starts to believe that she is trying to kill him, and he becomes obsessed with finding her killer.

He starts to investigate all the people who were close to her, including her ladies-in-waiting and her doctor. He even suspects his own son, who was born after Mumtaz's death.

The investigation takes a dark turn when Shah Jahan has one of his suspects killed. This only makes him more paranoid and obsessed, and he starts to lose touch with reality.

The film culminates with a tragic scene in which Shah Jahan, completely mad now, stabs his own son to death, thinking he is Mumtaz's killer. He is then arrested and imprisoned for the rest of his life.

The film ends with a shot of the Taj Mahal, now shrouded in darkness and mystery.
