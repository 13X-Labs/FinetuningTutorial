In a small village in France during the Renaissance, a young woman named Aliza is born with a mark on her forehead in the shape of a dragon. When she is five years old, her parents are killed in a fire, and she is taken in by her uncle, a wizard named Gilbert. Gilbert teaches her everything he knows about magic, and she quickly becomes his apprentice.

As Aliza grows older, she becomes more and more interested in the dark arts. When she is sixteen, she sneaks into Gilbert's study and reads one of his forbidden books. This unleashes a powerful demonic force that takes control of her body. Gilbert is able to exorcise the demon, but not before it leaves a deep mark on Aliza's soul.

As she continues to study under Gilbert, Aliza becomes obsessed with mastering the dark arts. She spends hours in the wizard's study, poring over his books and practicing forbidden spells. Gilbert grows worried about her mental state, and he begins to distance himself from her.

One night, while Gilbert is away on business, Aliza summons a demon to her bedroom. The demon takes possession of her again, and this time it is even stronger than before. It takes over her mind and body, and she is transformed into a powerful sorceress.

With the demon's help, Aliza amasses a large army of followers. She leads them on a crusade across Europe, conquering villages and towns along the way. The townsfolk live in terror of the sorceress and her demon army.

As they approach the French capital, Aliza's army is met by a large force of knights and soldiers. A fierce battle ensues, and eventually the demon army is defeated. Aliza is captured and taken to the castle dungeon, where she is to be executed.

As she awaits her execution, Aliza reflect on her life and the choices she has made. She regrets wasting her life on power and destruction, and she wonders what could have been if she had chosen a different path.

Just before she is killed, Aliza is visited by the demon one last time. It tells her that she was always destined to become a servant of evil. It was her destiny to lead the demon army and conquer the world.

Aliza dies with regret in her heart, knowing that she could have been so much more.
