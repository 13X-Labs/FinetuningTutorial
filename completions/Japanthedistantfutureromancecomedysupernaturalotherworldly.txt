In the distant future, in a Japan that is both modern and magical, two young people meet and fall in love.

Kaoru is a young woman who works in a Tokyo office by day and moonlights as a professional matchmaker by night. She's very good at her job, and she's about to make a perfect match between two young people who are completely wrong for each other.

But then she meets Riku, a handsome young man who has just moved to Tokyo from the countryside. Riku is completely enchanted by the city and its strange magical energy, and he quickly falls for Kaoru.

Despite the fact that they are complete opposites, the two young people are drawn to each other and they begin a tentative romance.

But then strange things start happening in Tokyo. The magical energy that Riku was so fascinated by starts becoming a force that is wreaking havoc on the city. Buildings are destroyed, people are turned into animals, and it's clear that something otherworldly is going on.

Riku and Kaoru will have to figure out what's going on and stop it before it destroys the city and their relationship along with it.
