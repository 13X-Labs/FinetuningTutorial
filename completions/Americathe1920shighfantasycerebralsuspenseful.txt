As the Roaring Twenties dawn in America, a group of six unlikely companions are drawn together by a shared destiny. Half-elf ranger Arwen, human wizard Merlin, dwarf fighter Gimli, changeling rogue Legolas, halfling thief Frodo, and entspring creature Samwise must band together to stop an evil sorceress from unleashing a powerful artifact that will enslave all of humanity.

The evil sorceress, Morgana, has unearthed an ancient relic known as the One Ring. This powerful artifact has the ability to enslave the minds of all who wear it. Morgana plans to use the One Ring to take control of the world's leaders and plunge the world into darkness.

The six heroes must stop Morgana before she can use the One Ring's power. They must journey across America, facing dangerous foes and uncovering dark secrets, in order to find the One Ring and destroy it before it's too late.

Can the six unlikely companions stop Morgana and save the world from enslavement?
