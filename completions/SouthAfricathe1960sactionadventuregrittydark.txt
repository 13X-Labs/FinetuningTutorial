When apartheid was first established in South Africa, the government made a deal with a powerful criminal syndicate in exchange for their help in maintaining control over the black population. The syndicate, led by a ruthless crime boss, ran a protection racket and provided muscle for the government. They were also involved in smuggling and other illegal activities.

The syndicate's operations are largely overseen by two ruthless and efficient lieutenants. One is a cold-blooded killer who takes pleasure in his work. The other is a more level-headed woman who is equally as deadly.

The film follows the syndicate as they go about their business, often resorting to brutal violence to get what they want. We see the main characters carrying out orders, ruthlessly torturing and killing those who cross them. We also see them carrying out more mundane tasks such as running protection rackets and smuggling operations.

As the film goes on, we see the cracks beginning to show. The cold-blooded killer is becoming more and more unhinged, while the level-headed woman is growing tired of the ruthless violence. Eventually, they both come to the realization that they want out.

The syndicate boss, sensing that his lieutenants are growing restless, decides to promote a new crop of young killers to take their place. He also begins to put more pressure on them to carry out more and more dangerous jobs.

The final straw comes when the boss orders them to carry out a hit on a rival syndicate leader. The target is heavily guarded and the job goes badly, with several of the syndicate's men being killed.

The two lieutenants realize that they can't keep working for the syndicate boss and that they need to get out. They hatch a plan to kill him and take over the syndicate. The cold-blooded killer sets a trap for the syndicate boss, while the level-headed woman lures him into it. The plan works and the syndicate boss is killed.

The two lieutenants then take over the syndicate and begin to run it in a more efficient and less violent manner. They quickly become the most powerful criminal organization in South Africa. The film ends with them looking to the future and expanding their operations into other countries.
