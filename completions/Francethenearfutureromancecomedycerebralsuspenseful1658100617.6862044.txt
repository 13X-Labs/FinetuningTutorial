In the near future, France is on the brink of a major political upheaval. The ruling party is in disarray and the opposition is gaining ground. In the midst of this, a young woman named Isabelle is trying to make her way in the world. She's smart, ambitious, and passionate, but she's also a bit of a klutz. When she accidentally spills a drink on a handsome stranger at a party, she thinks her chances of making a good impression are ruined. But the stranger, Olivier, is intrigued by Isabelle and asks her out on a date.

Olivier is a successful businessman, but he's also a bit of a rebel. He's not interested in the same things as other people his age, and he's not afraid to speak his mind. He and Isabelle hit it off immediately, and they start dating. They have a lot of fun together, and Isabelle starts to see a different side of Olivier. He's charming, funny, and completely different from any other guy she's ever dated.

But as the political situation in France starts to heat up, Olivier starts to become more and more involved. He's passionate about his beliefs, and he's not afraid to stand up for what he thinks is right. Isabelle is worried about him, but she's also proud of him. As the situation in France escalates, they find themselves in the middle of a dangerous game of politics and love.
