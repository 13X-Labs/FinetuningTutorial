A year has passed since a devastating earthquake hit Italy, leaving the country in ruins. The government has been rebuilding, but there are still many areas that have not been touched. In one of these areas, a group of survivors are living in an abandoned city. They are scraping by, trying to find food and supplies. One day, they stumble upon a secret government facility. Inside, they find a terrifying secret: the government has been experimenting with a new type of weapon, one that can control the minds of its victims. The survivors must battle the armed guards and escape the facility before it's too late.
