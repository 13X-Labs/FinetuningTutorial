Evelyn, a young woman from America, has come to Japan in the 1920s to work as a missionary. She is eager to help the people she meets and quickly becomes friends with many of the locals. However, she is also constantly pining for the love of her life, who is back in America.

One day, while out walking, Evelyn comes across a handsome young man named Hiro. Hiro is a bit of a mystery, as he is very reticent and doesn't seem to have any friends. Evelyn is immediately drawn to him and begins to try to get to know him better.

As the two spend more time together, they begin to fall in love. However, just as they are about to confess their love for each other, Hiro is called back to Japan to help with his family's business. He tells Evelyn that he will come back for her, and the two part ways, promising to reunite.

Evelyn spends the next few months waiting for Hiro to return, but he never does. Eventually, she begins to move on with her life, but she always wonders what happened to the man she loved.

One day, out of curiosity, Evelyn decides to visit Hiro's family's business. To her surprise, she finds Hiro there, working as the company's president. It turns out that Hiro's family had been against him dating a foreigner, so he had to choose between his love for Evelyn and his duty to his family. He chose his family, but he has never stopped thinking about Evelyn.

Now that they have both finally found each other again, they can finally confess their love for each other and start their life together.
