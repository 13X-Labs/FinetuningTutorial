In Japan during the Renaissance, a young woman named MIA is born with a special gift. She can see into the future and know what people are thinking. Her gift is both a blessing and a curse, as she is constantly bombarded with visions of the future, many of which she does not understand. As she grows up, she tries to use her gift to help people, but is often met with skepticism and fear.

One day, MIA meets a young man named KEN who is also gifted with supernatural abilities. He can communicate with animals and control the element of fire. The two of them become fast friends and soon discover that they have a lot in common. They both feel like they are different from everyone else and that they do not really fit in.

Together, MIA and KEN use their gifts to help people and fight evil. They often find themselves in dangerous situations, but they always manage to come out on top. They eventually fall in love with each other and get married. They have a happy life together and use their gifts to make the world a better place.
