Alexa and her friends, Mia and Jaida, are three teenage girls who are eager to experience everything the world has to offer. They're also supernaturally gifted; each girl has a unique ability that sets her apart from the other two. Mia can see the future, Jaida can read people's thoughts, and Alexa can speak to ghosts.

The girls use their abilities to their advantage, using Mia's gift to score good grades on tests, Jaida's to find out whether a boy likes her back, and Alexa's to communicate with her late mother.

One day, while they're hanging out at the local mall, the girls see a group of boys roughing up a young man. They intervene and manage to chase the boys away. The man, who introduces himself as Koa, is grateful and asks the girls to hang out with him.

The girls are hesitant at first, but they eventually warm up to Koa and the four of them become fast friends. Koa introduces the girls to his world; a world of magic and wonder. He takes them to see a verdant forest that is said to be inhabited by fairies, and they even meet a friendly ghost who helps them solve a mystery.

The girls are thrilled by their adventures with Koa and they start to fall for him, hard. But there's one problem; Koa is a ghost. He died in a car accident four years ago, and only returned to the world of the living because he fell in love with Alexa.

Now, the girls must find a way to help Koa move on to the afterlife so he can be at peace. But that means saying goodbye to the boy they all love.
