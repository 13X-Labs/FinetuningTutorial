The film opens with a shot of the night sky, with a full moon shining bright. Cut to a close up of a young woman's face, looking up at the moon. She has a dreamy, faraway look in her eyes.

The woman, named Lily, is a young artist living in New York City in the 1920s. She is deeply fascinated by the moon and often paints it in her art. Lily is also very interested in mysticism and the supernatural, and she spends her nights reading books on the occult.

One night, Lily has a strange dream in which she sees a great tree in the middle of a dark forest. At the base of the tree is a large door, and standing in front of the door is a mysterious figure clad in a hooded cloak. The figure beckons to Lily and she feels compelled to follow.

Lily wakes up from the dream feeling disturbed, but can't shake the feeling that it was somehow significant. She decides to take a walk in the park to clear her head.

As Lily walks through the park, she suddenly has the feeling she is being watched. She turns around and sees a large black crow perched on a nearby tree branch, staring at her with its beady eyes. Lily has the uncanny feeling that the bird is trying to tell her something.

Suddenly, the crow takes flight and Lily feels compelled to follow it. The bird leads her deep into the park, to a spot she has never been before. There, in a clearing, stands the great tree from her dream. And standing in front of the tree is the hooded figure.

The figure beckons to Lily once more and she approaches. When she is just a few feet away, the figure pulls back its hood, revealing a face that is half-human, half-bird. The creature introduces itself as a messenger from the spirit world.

The bird-spirit tells Lily that she has been chosen to embark on a great quest. An evil force is gathering in the world and Lily must stop it. She will be given special powers and guidance from the spirit world, but the journey will be fraught with danger.

Lily readily agrees to undertake the quest, and the bird-spirit bestows upon her a magical necklace. The necklace will protect Lily and give her the strength she needs for the challenges ahead.

The bird-spirit leads Lily to a door in the tree. The door opens onto a swirling vortex of light. Lily steps through, and the door closes behind her.

She finds herself in a strange and fantastical world. She is met by a group of fairies who tell her she must go to the court of the Fairy Queen. Lily sets off on her journey, encountering all sorts of magical creatures along the way.

Finally, she reaches the Fairy Queen's court. The Fairy Queen tells Lily that the evil force she must stop is a wizard who plans to enslave all the creatures of the forest. The wizard is gathering an army of dark creatures to carry out his evil plans.

Lily must find the wizard's lair and stop him before it's too late. The Fairy Queen gives Lily a magical dagger and points her in the right direction.

Lily sets off once more, this time making her way through a dark and dangerous forest. She is constantly being attacked by the wizard's minions, but she manages to fight them off.

Finally, she reaches the wizard's lair. A ferocious battle ensues and Lily eventually emerges victorious. With the wizard defeated, the creatures of the forest are free and the world is saved.
