In India, in the near future, a young woman named Jiya falls in love with a man named Raj. They meet and start dating, but they keep their relationship a secret from their families. Jiya's father is a traditional man who wants her to marry a man of his choosing, but she is determined to marry Raj.

One day, Jiya's father finds out about their relationship and forbids them to see each other. Jiya is heartbroken, but she knows she won't be able to live without Raj. She comes up with a plan to elope with him. With the help of her best friend, she arranges everything and they run away together.

However, Jiya's father sends men after them. They are caught and brought back to Jiya's family home. Raj's parents are called, and they all sit down to try to work out a solution. Jiya's father is adamant that she marry someone else, but Raj's parents refuse to allow their son to marry someone who has been disobedient.

After a lot of discussion, they finally come to a compromise. Jiya and Raj will be allowed to marry, but Jiya's father will choose the wedding date. This way, he can ensure that Jiya marries a man of his choosing after Raj.

Jiya and Raj are happy with this arrangement and they begin planning their wedding. Everything is going well until Jiya's father suddenly dies. This throws everything into turmoil as Jiya's mother is now against the marriage. She wants her daughter to marry someone of a higher caste.

Raj and Jiya are still determined to marry each other, but they don't know how to convince Jiya's mother. They eventually come up with a plan. Raj will pretend to be interested in marrying a woman of a higher caste. This will make Jiya's mother think that he is good enough for her daughter.

Raj starts courting a woman from a wealthy family, and Jiya's mother is convinced. She gives her blessing for the marriage, and Jiya and Raj are finally able to get married. They have a beautiful ceremony and a happy life together.
