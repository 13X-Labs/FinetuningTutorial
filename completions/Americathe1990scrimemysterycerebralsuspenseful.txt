In the early 1990s, a series of brutal murders rocks a small town in upstate New York. The victims are all young women, and the killings bear a chilling similarity to a string of unsolved murders from the 1970s.

Detective John Doe is called in to investigate the murders. Doe is a gruff, no-nonsense cop who has seen it all. He's immediately convinced that the killer is a copycat, re-enacting the killings from two decades earlier.

Doe's investigation leads him to the home of the original murders' only suspect, a man named Edward Shaw. Shaw is now a old man, living alone in a dilapidated house. When Doe interviews him, Shaw maintain his innocence, but he seems oddly eager to help with the investigation.

As Doe digs deeper, he discovers that Shaw has an extensive collection of crime scene photos and newspaper clippings from the original murders. It's clear that Shaw is obsessed with the case.

Doe begins to piece together a theory: that Shaw didn't just copy the murders, he committed them. But there's no way to prove it after all this time.

The murders continue, and Doe is under intense pressure to solve the case. He's convinced that Shaw is the killer, but he can't build a case against him.

Finally, Doe finds a crucial piece of evidence that links Shaw to the current murders. He races to arrest Shaw before he can strike again.

The film ends with Doe bringing Shaw to justice, finally solving the case that has haunted him for decades.
