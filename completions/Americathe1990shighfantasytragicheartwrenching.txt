Orphaned at a young age, half-elven brothers Legolas and Elladan are taken in by Lord Elrond of Rivendell. They grow up learning the ways of elves, and become skilled warriors. When they reach adulthood, they are sent on a quest to help humans in the war against Sauron, the Dark Lord.

During their quest, the brothers meet a young human woman named Arwen. Arwen is also on a quest, to find the One Ring which will help defeat Sauron. Arwen and the brothers quickly fall in love, but know that their relationship is forbidden. They must separated and continue on their respective quests.

The brothers eventually find the One Ring, but are ambushed by Sauron's forces. They are captured and tortured, but refuse to give up the location of the Ring. Arwen finds them and uses her powers to help them escape.

Sauron's army finds them again, and this time Arwen is captured. The brothers go to save her, but are outnumbered and outmatched. In the ensuing battle, Arwen is killed and the brothers are captured once more.

The brothers are brought before Sauron, who reveals that he knows of their relationship with Arwen. He tortures them further, hoping to get them to reveal the location of the Ring. The brothers refuse, and are killed.

With the brothers gone, Sauron believes he has won. However, Arwen's love for the brothers gives her the strength to defeat Sauron. She uses the Ring to destroy him, and the brothers' sacrifice is not in vain.
