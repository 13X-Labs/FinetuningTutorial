When China's one-child policy is finally abolished, many families are suddenly faced with the decision of whether or not to have a second child. For the Zhang family, this proves to be a difficult decision as they already have their hands full with their five-year-old daughter, Lily. However, after much deliberation, they decide to go ahead with having another baby.

Lily is over the moon at the prospect of becoming a big sister and can't wait to meet her new baby brother or sister. However, when her baby sister is born, she is not what Lily was expecting. In a country where boys are highly prized over girls, Lily feels disappointed and left out.

However, as she gets to know her sister, Lily comes to love her just as much as any brother. Despite the cultural expectations, the Zhang family grows to adore their two children equally.

As the girls grow up, they remain close, bonded by their shared experience of growing up in a country that doesn't always appreciate girls as much as boys. They lean on each other for support and advice, navigating the ups and downs of life and love together.

And eventually, they both find happiness in their own lives, with Lily finding love with a kind and gentle man who loves her for who she is, and her sister finding success in her career. They may not have been the Zhang family's ideal children, but they turned out to be exactly what they needed.
