When the world was on the brink of destruction, the great wizard Merlin used his magic to create a series of powerful barrier spells that would protect the planet from the coming chaos. But one day, a dark force known as The Void began to break through the barriers, and Merlin knew that only one person would be able to stop it: the lost heir to the throne of France.

Merlin travels to the city of Paris and finds the lost heir, a young woman named Marie. Marie is reluctant to believe that she is the chosen one, but she agrees to help Merlin and sets out on a journey to find the magical artifacts needed to seal The Void away forever.

 Along the way, Marie discovers that she has magical powers of her own and must use them to fight off The Void's minions. With the help of her new friends, she eventually finds all of the artifacts and seals The Void away, saving the world.
