The year is 20xx, and the world is on the brink of total collapse. A group of scientists have been working tirelessly to find a way to prevent the impending disaster, but when all hope seems lost, they turn to a ancient Egyptian artifact for help.

The artifact is a powerful relic that is said to have the ability to turn back time. The scientists believe that if they can use the artifact to go back in time and prevent the disaster from occurring, they can save the world.

But when they activate the artifact, they are sent back to ancient Egypt instead of the future. They quickly realize that they are not alone in this time period, and that they are being hunted by a group of ruthless mercenaries who are after the relic.

The scientists must use all of their knowledge and skills to survive in this hostile environment and find a way back to the future before it's too late.
