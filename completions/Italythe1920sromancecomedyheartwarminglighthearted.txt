In the 1920s, Italy is a land of romance and beauty. Elisabetta is a young woman who is madly in love with a man named Lorenzo. Lorenzo is a poor man, but he is the most handsome man Elisabetta has ever seen. They meet one day in a crowded square in Rome and they instantly fall in love. They begin a whirlwind romance, spending every night together and dreaming of a future together.

Lorenzo must leave Rome to go back to his hometown in the countryside. Elisabetta is heartbroken, but they agree to write to each other every day. Elisabetta decides to move to the countryside to be closer to Lorenzo. She finds a job as a maid in a large villa. The owner of the villa, Signora Conti, takes a liking to Elisabetta and offers to pay for her to take lessons in how to be a lady. Elisabetta gladly accepts, as she knows that it will make her more attractive to Lorenzo.

As Elisabetta becomes more educated and refined, she also begins to change in other ways. She starts to distance herself from Lorenzo, feeling that he is not good enough for her. Lorenzo, meanwhile, is having trouble finding work and is becoming increasingly frustrated. He starts to drink heavily.

One day, Elisabetta receives a letter from Lorenzo. He is coming to visit her. She is excited, but also nervous. She decides to tell him that she has been taking lessons and is now a lady. When he arrives, she is shocked to see that he has changed. He is unkempt and looks like he has been living on the streets. They spend the day together, but it is clear that the spark is gone. Elisabetta is now a different person and Lorenzo is no longer the man she fell in love with. They say goodbye and go their separate ways.

Elisabetta is heartbroken, but she knows that it is for the best. She goes on to live a happy and successful life, while Lorenzo fades into obscurity.
