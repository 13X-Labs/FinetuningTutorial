Deborah and John are childhood friends who grew up together in a small town in South Africa. They went to the same schools and shared many of the same experiences. As they grew older, their feelings for each other began to change from friendship to something more.

However, just as they were about to confess their love for each other, Deborah's family moved away and the two were forced to part ways. They kept in touch through letters and phone calls, but it was not the same as being together.

One day, out of the blue, John shows up at Deborah's door. He has quit his job, sold everything he owns, and is here to finally tell her how he feels. Deborah is shocked, but delighted, and the two spend the day catching up and rekindling their relationship.

As they talk, they realize that they have both always wanted to see the world. They make a spontaneous decision to buy a van and travel together. They spend the next year touring South Africa, falling deeper in love with each other and with the country they call home.

At the end of their journey, they return to Deborah's hometown and get married. They live happily ever after, raising a family of their own and sharing their love of adventure with the world.
