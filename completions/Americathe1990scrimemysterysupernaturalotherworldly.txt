In the early 1990s, America is in the throes of a crime wave. Supernatural forces are seemingly at work, as a string of brutal murders and abductions rock the country. The FBI's Special Investigations Unit is called in to investigate, and they quickly realize that they are dealing with something beyond the scope of their training.

The team's leader, Agent Mulder, is a firm believer in the supernatural, and he is convinced that these crimes are the work of demons or otherworldly beings. His partner, Agent Scully, is a skeptic, but she is open to the possibility that there could be a rational explanation for the strange events.

As the team digs deeper, they uncover a conspiracy involving the government, the military, and a secret society that is trying to harness the power of the otherworldly beings for their own purposes. They realize that they are in way over their heads, but they are determined to stop the evil forces at work before more innocent people are harmed.
