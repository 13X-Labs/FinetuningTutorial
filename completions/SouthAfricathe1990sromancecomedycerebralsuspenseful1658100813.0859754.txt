Naledi, a 23-year-old black South African woman, is in love with her best friend, Tumi, a 25-year-old black South African man. Naledi is afraid to tell Tumi how she feels because she doesn't want to ruin their friendship. However, she can't help but wonder what could be if they were together.

One day, Naledi musters up the courage to tell Tumi how she feels. To her surprise, Tumi feels the same way and they start dating. They keep their relationship a secret from their friends and family because they know that interracial relationships are still frowned upon in South Africa during the 1990s.

Naledi and Tumi are happy together and they slowly start to build a life together. They get married in secret and start a family. However, they both know that they can't stay in South Africa forever. They save up money and finally immigrate to the United States where they can live freely as a married couple with their kids.
