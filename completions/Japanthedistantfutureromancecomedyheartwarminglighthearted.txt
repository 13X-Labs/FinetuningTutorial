In the future, the world is a far different place than it is today. One major change is that the planet has been mostly taken over by robots. Humans now live in small, isolated communities and rarely interact with one another.

One day, a young woman named Sakura lives in one of these small communities. She is content with her life but feels like something is missing. One day, she decides to take a walk outside of her village.

Sakura comes across a strange sight: a robotic creature that looks just like a human. The two of them stare at each other for a moment before the robot runs off.

Curious, Sakura decides to follow the robot. She eventually finds herself in a hidden laboratory. There, she meets the robot's creator, a man named Hiroshi.

Hiroshi explains that the robot, which he has named Aiko, was designed to be a companion for humans. However, she is still in the early stages of development and is not yet ready to be released to the public.

Hiroshi and Sakura quickly become friends and begin to spend more time together. Eventually, they begin to develop feelings for each other. However, they both know that a relationship between a human and a robot is not possible.

One day, Hiroshi tells Sakura that he is moving away and will be taking Aiko with him. Sakura is heartbroken but understands that it is for the best.

Aiko is also sad to say goodbye to Sakura but is happy to be going with Hiroshi. As they leave, Sakura tells Aiko that she will always love her.

Aiko and Hiroshi begin a new life together and are eventually married. They have a daughter who they name Sakura after the woman who first showed them both what it means to love.
