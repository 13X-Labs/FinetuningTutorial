Japan, 1990s. 

 Mari is a young woman who lives a normal life with her family in Tokyo. One night, she is attacked by a demon and possessed by a spirit. The spirit is that of a powerful oni, who was once a human who was possessed by a demon and then became a powerful demon himself. 

The oni controls Mari and uses her to commit crimes and kill people. The oni is also able to possess other people and use them to further his goals. The police are baffled by the string of murders and are unable to catch the culprit. 

Mari's family is worried about her and they try to get her help, but the oni is too strong. They eventually realize that the only way to save Mari is to kill the oni. They enlist the help of a priest and a shaman to help them exorcise the demon. 

After a long and difficult battle, they are successful in exorcising the demon and saving Mari. The oni is destroyed and Mari is returned to her normal self.
