In Egypt, in the 1960s, a group of adventurers seek a lost tomb of a ancient Pharaoh. They are guided by a local guide, who is an expert in the area. The group is constantly under attack by snakes, spiders, and other deadly creatures. They also have to deal with bandits and treacherous people. They finally reach the tomb, but it is booby-trapped and they are forced to fight their way out. They are pursued by the enemies, but they make it out alive and find the treasure they were looking for.
