When Nelson Mandela is released from prison in 1990, South Africa is on the brink of change. For black people in the country, the world is about to get a whole lot better. But for two young people in love, the future is anything but certain.

Linda is a white South African girl, born and raised in a privileged family. Her parents are staunch supporters of the apartheid regime and have instilled in her their racist attitudes. However, Linda is not like her parents. She is kind-hearted and open-minded, and she has fallen in love with a black man, Isaac, who she met at university.

Linda knows that her relationship with Isaac is taboo, and if her family found out, they would disown her. But she can't help the way she feels, and she is willing to risk everything to be with the man she loves.

The two lovers must navigate a treacherous social landscape, filled with danger and prejudice. But as the country begins to change, so too does their relationship, and they are forced to confront the realities of a new South Africa.

Can their love survive in a world that is changing around them?
