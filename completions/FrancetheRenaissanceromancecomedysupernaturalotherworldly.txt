In the small French village of Mont Saint-Michel, the local residents are living in fear. A curse has been placed on the village, and every full moon, a monstrous beast comes down from the mountain and terrorizes the people. The only way to break the curse is to find true love's first kiss, but no one in the village has been able to do so.

One night, as the beast is about to attack, a young woman named Isabelle comes running into the village. She's being chased by a group of bandits, and she's desperately seeking shelter. The villagers take her in and try to protect her, but the beast is too strong. It manages to break into the village and take Isabelle away.

Isabelle wakes up in a strange place. She's been taken to the castle of Lord Robert, a wealthy nobleman who lives in the nearby city. Lord Robert tells her that he's been watching her from afar and he's fallen in love with her. He wants to make her his wife, but Isabelle is resistant. She wants to go home to her village.

 Lord Robert takes Isabelle on a tour of his city and introduces her to his lifestyle. She meets his friends and they all seem to like her. They convince her to stay and give Lord Robert a chance.

As Isabelle gets to know Lord Robert, she starts to realize that he's not the monster she thought he was. He's kind, gentle, and he truly cares for her. She starts to fall in love with him, and she decides to stay in the city.

The two get married and they live happily ever after. The curse is finally broken and the villagers can live in peace.
