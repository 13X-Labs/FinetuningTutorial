In the 1960s, Japan is a country on the rise. Its economy is booming and its culture is becoming increasingly influential around the world. One of the most popular forms of entertainment in Japan is cinema. And one of the most popular genres of film is the romance/comedy.

The story of our film is set in this context. It follows the story of two young lovers, Akira and Makoto. They meet in college and quickly fall in love. However, their families are opposed to their relationship. Akira's father is a traditional man who wants him to marry a Japanese woman and start a family. Makoto's mother is ill and doesn't want her daughter to be burdened with caring for a husband.

Despite their families' objections, the two young lovers continue to see each other in secret. They have to sneak around and meet in secret locations, which only adds to the excitement of their young love. However, tragedy strikes when Makoto's mother suddenly dies. This throws the young couple into a tailspin. Makoto is devastated and she withdraws from Akira. She becomes cold and distant, forcing Akira to confront the possibility that he may never see her again.

But Akira is not ready to give up on their love. He continues to pursue Makoto, even though she remains distant. Finally, after months of persistence, Akira finally wears Makoto down and she agrees to marry him. They have a beautiful wedding and start a life together.

However, just as their happiness seems to be at its peak, tragedy strikes again. Akira is diagnosed with a terminal illness and given only a few months to live. Makoto is devastated. She tries to be strong for him, but she can't hide her sorrow.

The film follows the couple as they try to make the most of the time they have left together. They travel to Akira's hometown and spend time with his family. They visit Makoto's mother's grave. They rekindle their love for each other and find strength in each other during this difficult time.

Ultimately, the film is a tragic love story. But it is also a story of hope and resilience. It shows that even in the darkest of times, love can still shine through.
