In a far-off future, the once-great nation of Egypt is in a state of decline. The once-proud people are now a shadow of their former selves, living in a society that is rife with corruption and violence. Into this environment comes a young woman named Aya, who is determined to make a difference.

Aya is a idealistic young woman who has come to Egypt to work as a teacher. She is quickly disillusioned by the reality of life in the city, but she persists in her work. She meets a young man named Tarek, who is also trying to make a difference. The two of them quickly fall in love, but their relationship is tested by the harsh realities of life in Egypt.

The two of them strive to make a difference, but the odds are against them. The corrupt government is against them, and the people are too beaten down to stand up for change. But Aya and Tarek refuse to give up, and their love for each other gives them the strength to keep fighting.

In the end, their efforts are not enough. Egypt is still in decline, and Aya and Tarek are forced to leave the country. They leave with heavy hearts, but they vow to never forget the country they loved and to continue fighting for change.
