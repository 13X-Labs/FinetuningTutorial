As the Renaissance dawns in France, the people are hard at work trying to eke out a living. But there is a new enchantment in the air. A young woman named Belle (our heroine) is different than the others in her village. She is drawn to the wild and has a heart for adventure. One day, she comes across a castle in the forest and is immediately drawn to it.

Belle is not the only one who has noticed the castle. A young man named Philippe is also enchanted by it. He is a prince, who has been cursed by a wicked witch. The curse can only be broken by true love's kiss. When Belle and Philippe meet, they instantly fall in love. But the witch is watching them and will not allow the curse to be broken.

The witch casts a spell on Belle, which takes her to a dark place. Philippe must go on a quest to find her and save her. With the help of some magical creatures, he is successful. And the two lovers are finally able to break the curse with a true love's kiss.
