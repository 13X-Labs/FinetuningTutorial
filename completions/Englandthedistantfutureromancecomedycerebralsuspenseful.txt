In the future, England is a peaceful and prosperous land. However, there is one small problem: the country is facing a severe shortage of eligible bachelors! In an effort to solve this problem, the government comes up with a radical solution: they will allow eligible women from other countries to come to England and marry English men.

As word of this spreads, women from all over the world flock to England, hoping to find their perfect match. Among them is a beautiful young woman named Sophia (played by the always charming Natalie Portman). Sophia has come to England with the hope of finding true love, but she quickly discovers that the men here are not what she expected.

Most of the men are either too shy or too awkward to be good husbands, and many of them are already married! Desperate to find a husband, Sophia turns to a handsome but mysterious man named Rufus (played by the always dashing Jude Law). Rufus is a high-ranking government official who seems to be perfect for Sophia.

However, as Sophia gets to know Rufus, she realizes that he is not the perfect husband material that she thought he was. Rufus is a cold and distant man who is more interested in his work than in his marriage. Sophia begins to think that she made a mistake in choosing Rufus, but she soon discovers that he has a dark secret: he is a member of a secret government organization that is planning to overthrow the government!

As Sophia starts to uncover the secrets of Rufus' organization, she also starts to fall in love with him. But can she trust him? And will he be able to save her from the dangerous world of politics that he has pulled her into?
