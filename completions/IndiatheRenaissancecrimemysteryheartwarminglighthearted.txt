In the late 15th century, India is a melting pot of cultures, religions and races. The Sultanate of Delhi is in control of most of the country, but there are many smaller kingdoms dotting the landscape. One of these is the Kingdom of Vijayanagar, ruled by the mighty Raja Krishnadevaraya.

Krishnadevaraya is a just and fair ruler, loved by his people. He has a close relationship with his minister, Vidyaranya, who is like a father to him.

One day, a gruesome murder is committed in the palace. The victim is a member of the royal family. Krishnadevaraya is distraught and decides to personally investigate the case.

He soon discovers that the killer is none other than Vidyaranya. Vidyaranya confesses that he committed the murder in order to protect Krishnadevaraya from a plot by the Sultan of Delhi to overthrow him.

Krishnadevaraya is saddened by this turn of events, but forgives Vidyaranya and allows him to retire in peace. The people of Vijayanagar continue to live happily under Krishnadevaraya's just rule.
