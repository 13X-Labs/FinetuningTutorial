When Mei Li is born in China during the 1960s, her parents know that she is special. They instantly fall in love with their beautiful baby girl and decide to name her “Mei Li”, which means “beautiful” in Mandarin.

As Mei Li grows up, she becomes known as the most beautiful girl in her village. She always has a smile on her face, which endears her to everyone she meets. When she reaches the age of 16, Mei Li is chosen to be the bride of the handsome young man named Feng.

Feng is a kind and gentle man, but he is also poor. Although he is not wealthy, Feng is the best husband that Mei Li could have asked for. The two of them are very much in love and they have a happy life together.

However, when the Chinese Cultural Revolution starts, everything changes. Feng is forced to join the Red Army and he is sent away to fight in the war. Mei Li is left behind, pregnant with Feng’s child.

Mei Li is heartbroken when Feng is killed in battle. She raises her son, Feng’s child, on her own and does her best to instill in him the values of kindness and compassion that Feng cherished.

Although she is widow, Mei Li does not give up on love. When she meets a handsome man named Shen, she falls in love with him and they get married. Shen is a good man and he loves Mei Li and her son, Feng’s child, as if they were his own.

The family is happy together and they live a peaceful life until the day that Feng’s ghost appears to Mei Li. Feng’s ghost tells Mei Li that he is not at peace and he needs her help. He asks Mei Li to find his body and give him a proper burial.

Mei Li sets out on a journey to find Feng’s body. She has many adventures and she meets many interesting people along the way. Finally, she finds Feng’s body and she gives him a burial with all the honors due to a brave soldier.

After Feng is properly buried, his ghost is able to rest in peace. Mei Li returns home to her family and she is happy to know that she has helped Feng find peace.
