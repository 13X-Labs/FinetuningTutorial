The film opens with a shot of the French countryside, with rolling hills and medieval castles in the distance. A voiceover explains that it is the year 1570, and France is in the midst of a civil war. We see a group of soldiers on horseback, riding through the countryside. They come across a small village and stop to rest. One of the soldiers, a young woman named Isabelle, goes into the village to get some water.

While she is there, she sees a woman being accosted by a group of men. She intervenes and is able to rescue the woman, who tells her that she is being chased by a group of demons. The woman begs Isabelle to help her, and Isabelle agree. She takes the woman back to the soldiers and they set off to find the demons.

After a long journey, they come across a castle that is surrounded by a group of demons. The woman tells them that this is where the demons are holding her husband captive. Isabelle and the other soldiers charge into the castle, fighting their way through the demons. They eventually reach the man, who is being held in a dungeon. They rescue him and return to the village.

The film ends with the voiceover explaining that the demons were defeated, but they left a lasting impression on Isabelle. She is now known as the Demon Hunter.
