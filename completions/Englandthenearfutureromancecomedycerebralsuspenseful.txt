INT. ENGLAND, NEAR FUTURE - DAY

Alice, a young woman in her mid-twenties, is walking through a park in England. She's on her way to meet her boyfriend, Charlie, for lunch. As she walks, she notices a man watching her from across the park. She's never seen him before, but there's something about him that makes her feel uneasy.

Alice continues walking, but she can't shake the feeling that the man is following her. She looks over her shoulder and sees that he's now just a few feet behind her. She starts to walk faster, but the man quickens his pace as well. Suddenly, Alice is running.

The man catches up to her and grabs her arm. Alice tries to pull away, but he tightens his grip. She looks into his eyes and sees pure evil.

Alice is paralyzed with fear. The man drags her into a secluded area of the park and starts to assault her. She screams for help, but no one is around to hear her.

Alice is fighting for her life. She knows she has to stay alive until Charlie comes to find her. She won't give up without a fight.

Suddenly, the man is hit in the head with a rock. He falls to the ground, unconscious. Alice looks up to see her savior: Charlie.

Charlie helps Alice to her feet and they embrace. They both know that they're lucky to be alive.

Alice and Charlie go to the police station to report the attack. They tell the officers everything that happened. The officers take down their statements and assure them that the man will be caught and brought to justice.

Alice and Charlie are shaken by the attack, but their love for each other is stronger than ever. They know that they'll never let anything come between them again.
