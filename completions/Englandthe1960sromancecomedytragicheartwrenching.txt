The film opens with a scene of busy city traffic in London. The camera pans down to a small car stuck in the middle of the road. The driver, a young woman in her early twenties, is frantically honking her horn, but no one is moving. She looks around, frustrated and desperate.

Suddenly, a handsome man on a motorcycle pulls up beside her. He takes one look at the situation and offers to help. The woman, who is named Lily, is hesitant at first, but she quickly agrees.

The man, who introduces himself as Jack, helps Lily push her car out of the way. He offers to take her home, but Lily declines. Thanking him for his help, she drives off.

The next day, Lily is at work when she gets a call from her best friend, who is getting married. Lily is thrilled for her friend, but she can't help but feel a little jealous. She is also reminded of her own single status.

Later that day, Lily goes to pick up her younger sister from school. As they are walking home, they spot Jack on his motorcycle. He waves and they stop to talk. Jack tells them that he just moved to the area and is looking for a place to stay. Lily's sister immediately offers their spare room.

Lily is hesitant, but she eventually agrees. Jack moves in and life seems perfect. He and Lily begin to fall in love, but just as they are about to confess their feelings for each other, tragedy strikes.

Lily's sister is killed in a car accident. Lily is devastated and she withdraws from everyone, including Jack. He tries to reach out to her, but she pushes him away.

One day, Lily decides to take a walk. She ends up at Jack's house and she finally breaks down. He comforts her and they confess their love for each other. They get married and live happily ever after.
