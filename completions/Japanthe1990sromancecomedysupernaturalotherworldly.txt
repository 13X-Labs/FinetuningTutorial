One night, Akiko is out walking near a river when she sees a group of people standing on the bridge, about to jump. She runs to stop them, but she slips and falls into the river herself. As she is about to drown, she is rescued by a man named Kenta. Kenta is a ghost, who died many years ago.

Kenta begins to visit Akiko regularly, and the two of them fall in love. However, Akiko is still in love with Tatsuya, and she can't forget him. Kenta is heartbroken, but he continues to visit her.

One night, Tatsuya and Setsuko have a big argument, and Tatsuya leaves the house. He comes to Akiko's apartment, and the two of them end up sleeping together. Akiko feels guilty, but she can't help but be happy that she was finally able to be with Tatsuya.

The next day, Tatsuya goes back to Setsuko and tries to patch things up. However, she can tell that he was with Akiko, and she's heartbroken. She tells him to leave and never come back.
