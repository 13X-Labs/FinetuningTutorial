ISABELLA, a beautiful young woman in 16th century France, is caught up in a web of betrayal, intrigue, and murder when she falls in love with GABRIEL, the son of her family’s bitter rivals.

Gabriel’s father, MARCUS, is the head of a powerful crime syndicate in Paris and Isabella’s family is one of his chief competitors. When Marcus finds out about the relationship, he does everything in his power to tear them apart.

Isabella and Gabriel are forced to go into hiding, but Marcus is relentless in his pursuit. He eventually catches up to them and separate them, sending Gabriel off to prison and Isabella into a life of servitude.

Isabella is brokenhearted and her only hope is to rescue Gabriel from prison. She hatches a daring plan, but it fails and she is captured. Marcus tortures her for information but she refuses to talk.

In a fit of rage, Marcus orders Isabella to be executed. As she is being led to the gallows, she spots Gabriel in the crowd and they share one final look of love before she is hanged.
