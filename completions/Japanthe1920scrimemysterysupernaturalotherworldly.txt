The film opens with a shots of a bustling city in Japan during the 1920s. We see people going about their lives, going to work, and enjoying time with friends and family. There is a feeling of joy and happiness in the air.

But there is also an undercurrent of unease and tension. We see people walking down the street with their eyes downcast, avoiding eye contact. There is a feeling that something is not quite right.

We are introduced to our main character, a young woman named Sakura. Sakura is a bright and headstrong woman who is not afraid to speak her mind. She is also a bit of a rebel, and she does not conform to the expectations of her family or society.

Sakura is working as a journalist for a local newspaper. She is investigating a series of strange deaths that have been occurring around the city. The victims all seem to have died from natural causes, but there is something uncanny about their deaths.

Sakura is convinced that these deaths are not natural, and she is determined to find out what is really going on. She teams up with a detective named Tagami. Together, they begin to uncover a sinister plot that goes far beyond just the deaths of a few people.

They discover that the deaths are part of a much larger plot, one that involves the supernatural and otherworldly beings. Sakura and Tagami must race against the clock to stop the plot from coming to fruition.

They face danger at every turn, but they are also driven by a powerful sense of justice. In the end, they prevail and the city is saved. But the cost is high, and Sakura and Tagami are forever changed by the events that they have witnessed.
