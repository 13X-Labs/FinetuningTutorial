Marquis de Lafayette, a French general and close friend of George Washington, is having a dinner party in his chateau outside of Paris. Lafayette's wife, Adrienne, is expecting their first child and has been confined to bed. 

Lafayette's nephew, Henri, and his best friend, Jean-Paul, are in attendance. Henri is in love with a commoner, Marie, and is trying to find the courage to tell his uncle. Jean-Paul is an aspiring musician and is hoping to find a patron at the party. 

As the guests are enjoying dinner, a group of bandits led by a woman named Genevieve burst in and demand everyone hand over their valuables. Lafayette tries to reason with the bandits, but Genevieve is not interested in negotiating.

In the midst of the robbery, Adrienne's water breaks and she goes into labor. Genevieve is hesitant to leave the pregnant woman behind, but Lafayette convinces her to go. He promises that he will not try to stop her from leaving if she lets Adrienne and the baby go. 

Genevieve agrees and the bandits make their escape. Lafayette and the other guests tend to Adrienne, who safely delivers the baby. In the aftermath of the birth, Lafayette and Henri talk. Henri confesses his love for Marie and Lafayette gives his blessing.

Jean-Paul ends up finding a patron for his music and Marie comes to visit Lafayette's chateau. The two couples are married in a double ceremony and everyone lives happily ever after.
