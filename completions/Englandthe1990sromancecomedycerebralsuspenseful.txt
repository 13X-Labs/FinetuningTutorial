She's always been unlucky in love and has a string of failed relationships. Her latest relationship is with a married man who is about to leave his wife. Carolyn is plagued by self-doubt and is convinced that she's not good enough for him. She's also scared that she's going to get hurt again.

Carolyn's friends, Sarah and Nick, are a happily married couple who try to set her up with various eligible men. But none of them seem to be right for her. One day, Carolyn meets a handsome, charming man named John at a local bookstore. They hit it off immediately and start dating.

John seems like the perfect man for Carolyn. He's considerate, gentle, and funny. They have great chemistry together. However, Carolyn soon discovers that John is hiding a dark secret. He's actually a serial killer who preys on single women. Carolyn is terrified but decides to stay with John, convinced that she can change him.

As their relationship deepens, John's murderous urges become harder to control. One night, he comes close to killing Carolyn. She manages to talk him out of it and he agrees to get help.

A few months later, John is arrested for the murders of several women. Carolyn is relieved that she's finally free of him. She can now move on with her life and find true happiness.
