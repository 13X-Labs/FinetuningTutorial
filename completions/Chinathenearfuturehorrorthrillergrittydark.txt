A group of American tourists are in China for a vacation. They're staying in a hotel in Beijing when they're suddenly attacked by a group of Chinese soldiers. The soldiers are armed with assault rifles and start shooting at the tourists. The tourists try to escape, but they're all killed.

The Chinese government blamed the attack on terrorists, but the truth is that the government was behind it. They wanted to kill Americans to try to start a war. The Chinese military is getting ready to launch a full-scale attack on the United States.

The United States military is on high alert, but they're not able to stop the Chinese attack. Cities across the country are being bombed. The president orders a nuclear strike on China.

The missiles launch, but they're intercepted by the Chinese military. The United States is destroyed, and the world is plunged into a nuclear winter. The few survivors are left to try to rebuild civilization in a world that's been ruined by war.
