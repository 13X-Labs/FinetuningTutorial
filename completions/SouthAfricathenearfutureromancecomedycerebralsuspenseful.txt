In a near-future South Africa, the government has collapsed and the country has descended into lawlessness. Amid the chaos, a group of activists have established a safe haven called Sanctuary. The residents of Sanctuary are working to build a new society, based on cooperation and equality.

One of the residents of Sanctuary is a young woman named Nandi. Nandi is a talented artist, and she has been nominated to design the new flag for Sanctuary. However, she is also secretly in love with her best friend, Anele.

Anele is a gentle and idealistic young man, who is deeply committed to the ideals of Sanctuary. However, he is also secretly attracted to Nandi.

As Nandi and Anele work together on the flag design, they begin to fall in love. But when Nandi's flag design is rejected by the Sanctuary Council, she becomes frustrated and starts to doubt the future of Sanctuary.

Anele is determined to win Nandi back, and he convinces the Council to let him redesign the flag. With Nandi's help, he creates a beautiful new flag that captures the spirit of Sanctuary.

As Nandi and Anele celebrate their victory, they share a passionate kiss. They know that they are destined to be together, and they are finally free to start a new life together.
