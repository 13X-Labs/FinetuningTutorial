2075, Bangalore. India has become the worldâ€™s leading economic and political power, and its culture has undergone a radical transformation. Bollywood has given way to a new, more cerebral brand of cinema, and the traditional arranged marriage has been replaced by a more liberal form of courtship.

A young woman, Sapna, is in love with a man named Raj, but her parents have arranged for her to marry someone else. Sapna is torn between her duty to her family and her love for Raj, but she ultimately decides to follow her heart.

Raj and Sapna elope and are married in a secret ceremony. They move to Mumbai, where they start a new life together.

However, their happiness is short-lived. India is going through a period of political turmoil, and Mumbai is caught in the middle of it. Raj and Sapna are forced to flee the city, and they end up in a remote village in the countryside.

Although they are happy to be together, they long for the hustle and bustle of the city. They eventually decide to move back to Mumbai, where they start a family and live happily ever after.
