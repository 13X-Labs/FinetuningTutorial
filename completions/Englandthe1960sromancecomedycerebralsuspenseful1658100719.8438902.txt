In England during the 1960s, Jane Austen's classic novel "Pride and Prejudice" is turned into a hit film. Lizzy Bennet, the heroine of the story, is a young woman who is trying to find her way in the world. She is bright, beautiful, and has a sharp wit, but she is also prejudiced against men. Her prejudice is put to the test when she meets Mr. Darcy, a wealthy and arrogant man who is also the star of the film. Lizzy is immediately attracted to Darcy, but she is also repelled by his arrogance. As they get to know each other, they begin to see past their differences and they fall in love. But just as they are about to confess their love for each other, they are interrupted by a phone call from Lizzy's mother, who tells her that her father has had a heart attack and is in the hospital. Lizzy rushes to her father's side, and Darcy follows. As they wait for news on Lizzy's father, they finally confess their love for each other. Lizzy's father recovers and the couple is married. They live happily ever after.
