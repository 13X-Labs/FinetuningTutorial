In the early 1990s, amid the backdrop of South Africa's tumultuous transition from apartheid to democracy, young Muslim woman Aaliyah and her family are caught up in the crossfire of a violent political conflict. Aaliyah's father is a prominent anti-apartheid activist who is targeted by the security forces. When he is killed in a bombing, Aaliyah is left to fend for herself and her family. She turns to her childhood friend, Ahmed, for support.

Ahmed is a charismatic political activist who is fighting for the rights of Muslim minorities in South Africa. He is also secretly in love with Aaliyah. When she turns to him for help, he is more than happy to oblige. He arranges for her to stay with his family in Cape Town.

Aaliyah and Ahmed begin to grow close as they navigate the political and social landscape of early 1990s South Africa. They face opposition from both their families and the outside world, but their love for each other is strong enough to overcome all obstacles.

The film culminates with the apartheid government fall and the country's first democratic elections. Aaliyah and Ahmed votes side by side, knowing that they have helped to make history. As they walk home hand in hand, they know that they have a bright future ahead of them.
