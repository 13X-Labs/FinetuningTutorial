In a distant future, the world is a much different place. Crime and mystery are rampant, and Japan is no exception. A group of detectives, led by the head detective, work tirelessly to solve these cases. However, their work is often stymied by the lack of evidence.

One day, a body is discovered in an alleyway. The detectives immediately begin their investigation. They soon discover that the victim was a young woman who worked at a local club. They also discover that she had been beaten and raped before she was killed.

The detectives work tirelessly to solve the case, but they are met with little success. Eventually, they discover that the young woman was involved with a powerful yakuza boss. They also discover that she was pregnant with his child.

The detectives confront the yakuza boss, but he denies any involvement in the woman's death. However, the detectives know that he is lying and they continue to press him for information.

The yakuza boss finally breaks down and confesses to the crime. He tells the detectives that he killed the woman because she was going to leave him and take his child with her.

The detectives arrest the yakuza boss and he is sentenced to life in prison. However, the young woman's death still weighs heavily on their minds. They know that they could have done more to save her and they vow to never let another victim suffer the same fate.
