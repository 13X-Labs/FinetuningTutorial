At thirty years old, Keiko Ishida is considered a failure by her family. She's unmarried, childless, and stuck in a dead-end job. So when her mother dies, Keiko is given one last chance to turn her life around. She's sent to live with her aunt in Tokyo and told to find a husband within a year.

Tokyo is a far different world than Keiko is used to, and she quickly discovers that the dating scene is more competitive than ever. She goes on dozens of dates, but none of them seem right. And time is running out.

Then, one night, Keiko meets a handsome stranger at a bar. He's mysterious, charming, and completely unlike any of the other men she's met. They hit it off immediately.

But there's one problem: the man is a yokai, a Japanese supernatural creature. And if Keiko can't find a way to break the spell he's put on her, she'll be his captive forever.

The story follows Keiko as she tries to navigate her new life in Tokyo, find a husband, and break the yokai's spell. Along the way, she discovers that love is more than just a fairytale and that sometimes, the most unlikely creatures can make the best partners.
