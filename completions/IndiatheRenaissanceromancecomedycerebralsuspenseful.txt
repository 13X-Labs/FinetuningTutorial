In the bustling city of Mumbai, India, a young woman named Aaliyah is trying to make her way in the world. She's smart, driven, and determined to succeed, but she's also a bit of a free spirit. She doesn't quite fit into the mold of a traditional Indian woman, and she's not sure what she wants out of life.

One day, Aaliyah's path crosses with that of a handsome young man named Raj. Raj is a royal prince, and he's been arranged to marry a woman he doesn't love. He's intrigued by Aaliyah, and he can tell that she's not like anyone he's ever met before.

Raj and Aaliyah begin a tentative friendship, and then they slowly start to fall in love with each other. However, they know that their relationship is forbidden. If they're caught, they could be killed.

Despite the risks, Raj and Aaliyah can't deny their feelings for each other. They elope and move to a remote village where they can be together. They're happy at first, but soon they realize that they're not quite sure how to live as a married couple. They don't have much in common, and they're both still adjusting to married life.

Meanwhile, Raj's family is frantic. They've been searching for him, and they finally track him down to the village where he's living with Aaliyah. They're outraged that he's married a commoner, and they demand that he come home with them.

Raj is torn. He loves Aaliyah, but he knows that his duty is to his family. He decides to go back to his family, leaving Aaliyah behind.

Aaliyah is heartbroken, but she knows that Raj made the right choice. She decides to move on with her life.

A few years later, Raj's father dies, and he becomes the king. He's still married to the woman he doesn't love, but he can't stop thinking about Aaliyah. He decides to take a chance and go back to the village to find her.

When he arrives, he discovers that Aaliyah is now married to another man. Raj is devastated, but he knows that he can't interfere in her life. He turns to leave, but Aaliyah's husband stops him. He tells Raj that Aaliyah has been unhappy since he left, and he thinks that Raj can make her happy again.

Raj doesn't know what to do, but he decides to take a chance. He goes back to Aaliyah and asks her to come back to him. She's hesitant at first, but she eventually agrees.

Raj and Aaliyah are finally able to be together, and they live happily ever after.
