In a near future Italy, the country is in a state of emergency. The government has been overthrown and a totalitarian regime now rules. Dissent is not tolerated and the people live in fear.

One night, a group of dissidents gather to plot a revolution. They are discovered by the authorities and a bloody battle ensues. In the end, the rebels are outnumbered and outgunned. They are captured and taken to a secret prison where they are tortured and executed.

The few survivors of the massacre are left traumatized and broken. They vow to never give up and continue the fight for freedom.
