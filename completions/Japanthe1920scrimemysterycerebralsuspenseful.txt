In 1920s Japan, a young woman named Miyuki is found dead in an alleyway, her throat slit. Inspector Ishirox of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department is assigned to the case. He quickly discovers that Miyuki was involved in a secret affair with a married man, and that she had been blackmailing him.

Ishirox's investigation leads him to the man's wife, who is also being blackmailed by Miyuki. The wife admits to hiring a hitman to kill Miyuki, but claims she didn't know that he would slit her throat.

Ishirox continues to investigate and discovers that the hitman was actually hired by the wife's lover, who was also having an affair with Miyuki. The lover wanted to get rid of both Miyuki and the wife so that he could have the wife all to himself.

In the end, Ishirox solves the case and arrests the wife's lover. The wife is also arrested, but Ishirox is not sure if she will be charged with anything since she didn't actually know that her lover had hired the hitman to kill Miyuki.
