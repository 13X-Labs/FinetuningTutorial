In the 1960s, organized crime was rampant in Italy. The Mafia controlled much of the country's illegal activity, including drug trafficking, gambling, and prostitution. Gio Battaglia is a young man who has just been inducted into the Mafia. He is eager to prove himself and make a name for himself in the organization.

The Mafia's main rivals are the Camorra, another criminal organization that is also involved in organized crime. Gio's first mission is to help his boss, Angelo Bruno, take down a Camorra drug trafficking operation. Gio is successful in his mission and is promoted within the Mafia.

The Camorra, however, is not going to take this lying down. They retaliate by bombing Angelo's car, killing him and his wife. Gio is devastated by the loss of his boss and friend, and is determined to get revenge.

He starts by killing the man who bombed Angelo's car. This sets off a bloody war between the Mafia and the Camorra. Gio becomes one of the most ruthless killers in the Mafia, and the Camorra is soon decimated.

However, Gio's rise to power within the Mafia comes at a price. He is increasingly involved in criminal activity, and his wife leaves him. He is also constantly in danger of being killed by rivals within the organization.

One day, Gio's enemies finally catch up to him. He is ambushed and gunned down in a hail of bullets. As he dies, Gio knows that he was not able to escape the life of crime he was born into.
