It was summertime in Japan during the 1960s, and Setsuko was enjoying the last of her days as a high school student. She had just broken up with her boyfriend and was feeling a bit lost. However, her life changed when she met a handsome stranger named Kaito. Kaito was different than any other boy she had ever met. He was kind, gentle, and had a mysterious air about him.

Setsuko quickly fell in love with Kaito, but there was one problem. Kaito was not human. He was a spirit from another world who had come to Earth to find a human to love. Setsuko was his only hope.

As the two of them started to grow closer, they faced challenges neither of them had anticipated. Kaito's world was in danger and Setsuko's family did not approve of their relationship. But none of that mattered, because the two of them were meant to be together.

The film would end with a wedding scene, with Kaito and Setsuko pledging their love for each other as they finally shared a life together in both of their worlds.
