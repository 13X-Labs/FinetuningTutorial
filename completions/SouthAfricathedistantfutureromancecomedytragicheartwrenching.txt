In the future, the world is a very different place. South Africa is now the most powerful country on the planet, and the people there are very proud of their heritage. One day, a young woman named Zulu is out walking in the streets of Johannesburg when she is hit by a flying car. She is knocked unconscious and taken to the hospital.

When she wakes up, she is told that she is in a coma and that she may never wake up. Her family is devastated. However, Zulu is determined to fight for her life. She has always been a fighter, and she is not going to give up now.

A few weeks later, Zulu begins to recover. She is still weak, but she is improving. Her family is overjoyed. However, Zulu is still not herself. She has lost her memory and does not remember who she is or what happened to her.

The doctors tell her family that it is very unlikely that she will ever regain her memory. However, Zulu is determined to try. With the help of her family and friends, she begins to piece her life back together.

Slowly but surely, Zulu starts to remember who she is. She remembers her friends, her family, and her life before the accident. However, she does not remember the man she was supposed to marry.

Zulu's fiance, Thabo, is heartbroken. He had been planning to propose to her on the day of the accident. Now, he does not know if she will ever be able to remember him or their relationship.

Thabo is a good man, and he is patient. He waits for Zulu, and eventually, she remembers him. They get back together and get married. They live happily ever after.
