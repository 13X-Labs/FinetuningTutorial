In Japan during the Renaissance, a young woman named Aki is born with the ability to see and communicate with ghosts. When she was five years old, her parents were killed in a Samurai raid, and she was taken in by a kindly couple who raised her as their own. Aki grew up to be a strong and independent woman, but she always felt a bit out of place in the human world.

One day, when Aki is out walking in the forest, she comes across a group of fairies who are in the middle of a battle with a group of demons. Aki uses her powers to help the fairies defeat the demons, and in doing so, she catches the eye of the Fairy Queen. The Queen asks Aki to join her army in the fight against the demons, and Aki agrees.

Aki quickly proves herself to be a powerful asset to the Fairy army, and she quickly rises through the ranks. She becomes friends with a fellow warrior named Hiroshi, and the two of them fight side by side against the demons.

But as the war against the demons goes on, it becomes clear that Aki is the only one who has the power to defeat the Demon King. The Fairy Queen begs Aki to take on this responsibility, but Aki is hesitant. She doesn't want to shoulder the burden of the entire war, and she also doesn't want to leave her friends behind.

But when the Demon King launches a final, desperate assault on the Fairy army, Aki knows that she has to act. She uses her powers to defeat the Demon King, but in doing so, she is mortally wounded. As she dies, she tells Hiroshi to take care of the Fairy Queen and the rest of the army.
