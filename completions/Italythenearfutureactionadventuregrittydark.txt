Opening Scene: A group of men are trying to break into a heavily guarded warehouse. One of the men, a skilled hacker, has managed to avoid the security measures and make his way inside. The rest of the group is waiting for his signal to move in. 

The hacker finds the mainframe and begins to access the files. However, he is quickly caught by the security guards. A shoot-out ensues, and the hacker is killed. The rest of the group is forced to retreat. 

Later, the group's leader, a man known only as "The Professor", is briefed on the failed mission. He is told that the man they were trying to get information from was a rogue government official who was selling state secrets. The Professor decides that they need to find out who this man was working with. 

The Professor puts together a team of specialists, including a skilled thief, a former soldier, and a experienced driver. They travel to Italy, where the rogue official was last seen. 

The team begins to track down anyone who may have been involved with the rogue official. They soon find themselves caught up in a web of lies and secrets. It becomes clear that there is a major conspiracy at play. 

As the team gets closer to the truth, they start to attract the attention of the people behind the conspiracy. The team is soon being hunted by both the police and the criminals. 

The team fights their way through countless obstacles, narrowly escaping death several times. Finally, they reach the heart of the conspiracy. They discover that the conspiracy goes all the way to the top of the government. 

The team takes down the conspirators and exposes the truth to the public. They become heroes, and the world is changed forever.
