In the 1990s, Japan is a land of great natural beauty, but it is also a land of great danger. Supernatural creatures known as yokai roam the land, preying on humans and causing havoc. The only thing that stands between the yokai and the human race is a group of warriors known as the yamabushi.

The yamabushi are a secretive group of warriors who have dedicated their lives to protecting humans from the yokai. They live in the mountains, away from society, and train tirelessly to hone their skills. They use special weapons and abilities to fight the yokai, and they are relentless in their pursuit of justice.

One day, a young woman named Sakura stumbles upon the secret headquarters of the yamabushi. Sakura is a talented musician, and she has been plagued by nightmares of the yokai since she was a child. She is drawn to the yamabushi and their mission, and she begs them to take her in.

The yamabushi are hesitant at first, but they eventually agree to train Sakura. She proves to be a natural warrior, and she quickly becomes indispensable to the team. Together, the yamabushi and Sakura battle the yokai and protect the people of Japan.

The film culminates with a massive battle against the evil yokai lord, who has been manipulating the yokai behind the scenes. The yamabushi and Sakura are outnumbered and outmatched, but they refuse to give up. In the end, they triumph over the yokai and save the day.
