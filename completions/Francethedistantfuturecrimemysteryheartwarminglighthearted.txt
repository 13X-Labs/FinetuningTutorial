In the distant future, the world is a very different place. France is a country that is struggling to maintain its place in the world. The economy is struggling, and the government is corrupt. The people are desperate, and crime is rampant. The police are ineffective, and the justice system is a joke.

In the midst of all this, there is one detective who is trying to make a difference. His name is Antoine Dupont, and he is the best detective in the country. He is dedicated to his job, and he is determined to make a difference.

One day, Dupont is called to investigate a murder. The victim is a wealthy businessman, and the suspects are his wife and her lover. Dupont is convinced that the wife is innocent, but he has to prove it.

As he investigates the case, he discovers that the husband was involved in some shady business deals. He was also having an affair with a young woman. Dupont realizes that the wife is not the only suspect.

He also finds out that the husband was planning to leave his wife. If he had, she would have gotten half of his fortune. However, if he died, she would get everything. Dupont is now convinced that the wife is guilty.

He sets a trap for her, and she is arrested. The trial is a media circus, but Dupont is confident that he has the evidence to convict her.

In the end, the wife is convicted and sent to jail. Dupont is a hero, and the people are finally able to sleep a little easier at night.
