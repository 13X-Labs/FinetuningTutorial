In the early 1990s, Valeria (23) is a young woman living in Northern Italy with her family. She is studying to be a doctor and is engaged to be married. However, her world is turned upside down when she meets Lorenzo (25), a handsome and charismatic man from Southern Italy. They instantly fall in love and begin a passionate affair.

Valeria's family is (understandably) not thrilled about her relationship with a man from a different region of the country, but they eventually come to accept him. Lorenzo is a bit of a free spirit and he encourages Valeria to let loose and enjoy life more. She begins to question her decision to settle down and get married. 

Although they are very much in love, Valeria and Lorenzo's relationship is not without its challenges. They are constantly fighting and making up. Lorenzo is often jealous and possessive, and Valeria is always worried that he will cheat on her. 

The plot reaches a climax when Valeria's fiance finds out about the affair. He confronts Lorenzo and demands that he leave Valeria alone. Lorenzo refuses, and the two men get into a physical altercation. Valeria's fiance is injured, and Lorenzo is arrested and put on trial. 

Valeria is torn between her loyalty to her fiance and her love for Lorenzo. In the end, she chooses Lorenzo and they move to Southern Italy to start a new life together.
