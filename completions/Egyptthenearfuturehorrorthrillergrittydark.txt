Mona is a young woman living in Egypt in the near future. Life is hard in Egypt, and it's only getting harder. Mona's family is struggling to make ends meet, and she's desperate to find a way to help them. When she's approached by a group of smugglers who tell her they can help her make some quick money, she agrees to help them.

Mona is tasked with smuggling a package of drugs into the country. She's given specific instructions on how to do it, and told that she'll be well-compensated for her efforts. She's also warned that if she's caught, she'll be executed. Mona is terrified, but she knows her family needs the money, so she agrees to do it.

The smuggling operation goes wrong, and Mona is caught by the authorities. She's sentenced to death, and is to be executed by firing squad. Mona is terrified, but she knows she has to go through with it. She's led to the execution yard, and the squad of soldiers takes aim. Just as they're about to fire, however, a group of masked men attacks the yard, killing the soldiers and freeing Mona.

The masked men are a group of rebels who are fighting against the government. They tell Mona that she's been chosen to help them in their fight. Mona is hesitant at first, but she eventually agrees to join them.

The rebels are fighting against a government that's become increasingly corrupt and oppressive. They're using whatever means necessary to try and take it down. Mona quickly realizes that she's in over her head, but she's determined to help the rebels in any way she can.

The rebellion is a violent one, and Mona quickly learns that there's no such thing as a "clean" kill. She also witnesses the unimaginable atrocities that the government is capable of. But she remains committed to the cause, and continues to fight.

The rebels are eventually able to overthrow the government, but it's a bloody victory. Mona is traumatized by all that she's seen and done, but she knows that it was all worth it. Egypt is finally free.
