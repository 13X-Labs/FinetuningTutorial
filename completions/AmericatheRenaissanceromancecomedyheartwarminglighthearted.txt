Prologue: 

In America, during the Renaissance, a young woman named Lily is living a peaceful life with her family. However, Lily's world is turned upside down when her parents are killed in a tragic accident. Lily is left alone in the world, and her only hope is to find a new home with her aunt and uncle in Italy.

Lily sets sail for Italy, but her ship is attacked by pirates. Lily is captured by the pirates and taken to their ship. However, the pirates are kind to her and eventually release her.

Lily finally arrives in Italy, but she is not greeted warmly by her aunt and uncle. They are cold and distant, and Lily feels like an outsider in their home.

One day, Lily meets a handsome young man named Giovanni. Giovanni is from a noble family, but he is not interested in their riches. He is attracted to Lily, and the two of them begin a romance.

Giovanni comes from a rival family, however, and Lily's aunt and uncle disapprove of the relationship. They forbid the two of them from seeing each other, but Lily is determined to be with Giovanni.

Lily and Giovanni come up with a plan to elope, but they are caught just before they can flee. Lily's uncle is furious, and he threatens to kill Giovanni if they do not end the relationship.

Lily and Giovanni are heartbroken, but they obediently end their relationship. They go their separate ways, each convinced that they will never see the other again.

Lily's aunt and uncle's attitude towards her begins to change, and they eventually come to accept her as part of their family.

One day, Lily receives a letter from Giovanni. He has finally been able to escape from his family, and he wants to meet Lily again.

Lily is overjoyed, and she immediately sets off to meet Giovanni. They are reunited at last, and they live happily ever after.
