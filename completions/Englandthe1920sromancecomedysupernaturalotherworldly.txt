In 1924, John Maybury is born in England to a wealthy family. His father, Edgar, is a barrister and his mother, Charlotte, is a socialite. When John is five, his parents divorce and he is sent to live with his grandparents in the countryside. John is a shy and introverted child who feels out of place in the rural setting.

One summer, John meets a girl named Lily Bridgewater. Lily is a free-spirited and eccentric girl who has a wild imagination. She tells John stories about faeries, magic, and other worlds. John becomes fascinated by Lily's stories and the two become close friends.

As they grow older, John and Lily's feelings for each other begin to change. They begin to explore their sexuality with each other and they fall in love. However, they keep their relationship a secret from their families.

One night, John and Lily sneak out to meet in the forest. Lily tells John that she is pregnant with his child. They decide to run away together to get married.

As they are running away, they are suddenly transported to a mystical realm. They are met by two faeries who tell them that they are chosen to be the new king and queen of this realm. John and Lily are hesitant at first, but they eventually agree to rule the kingdom together.

John and Lily spend the next few years happily ruling the kingdom. They have two children together, a boy and a girl. As their children grow older, John and Lily start to age as well. They know that they can't stay in the realm forever and that they must one day return to the human world.

One day, John and Lily say goodbye to their children and return to the human world. They are now elderly, but they are still in love with each other. They spend the rest of their lives together and their love story is remembered by all who knew them.
