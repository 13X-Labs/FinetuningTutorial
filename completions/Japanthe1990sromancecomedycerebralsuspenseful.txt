Kaori is a young woman living in Tokyo in the 1990s. She's just out of college and working as an assistant at a prestigious company. She's dating her boss, Takeshi, and things seem to be going well. However, Kaori is secretly in love with another man, Taro. Taro is a photographer and he's always seemed unattainable to her.

One day, Taro asks Kaori to be his assistant on a photography project. Kaori is thrilled to have the opportunity to work with him and to be able to spend more time with him. However, as they spend more time together, she starts to realize that Taro may not be the man she thought he was. He's moody and temperamental, and he doesn't seem to be interested in her romantically.

Despite her misgivings, Kaori continues to work with Taro and they become friends. Slowly, she starts to fall for him. However, just as she's about to tell him how she feels, she discovers that he's been secretly seeing another woman. Devastated, Kaori decides to quit her job and move away.

A few months later, she runs into Taro again. He tells her that he's sorry for what happened and that he's been thinking about her. They start dating and Kaori finally seems to have found the perfect man. However, just when things seem to be going well, tragedy strikes. Taro is killed in a car accident and Kaori is left heartbroken.

But even through her grief, Kaori knows that she's finally found true love. Taro may be gone, but he'll always have a place in her heart.
