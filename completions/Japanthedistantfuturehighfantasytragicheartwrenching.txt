In a distant future, Japan is a land of great danger and darkness. The once peaceful empire has been torn apart by war, and the few remaining survivors are struggling to rebuild their lives. One such survivor is a young woman named Akira. She was born into a noble family, but her parents were killed in the war. She was taken in by a kindly old woman who raised her as her own. Akira is a strong and determined young woman, and she has dreams of one day becoming a great warrior like her parents.

One day, Akira comes across a group of criminals who have been terrorizing the local villagers. She bravely stands up to them and drives them off. However, one of the criminals is a powerful sorcerer who puts a curse on her. The curse causes Akira to gradually turn into a monstrous beast. She is horrified at what is happening to her, and she desperately seeks a way to break the curse.

Akira's only hope is to find the legendary sword of the first Emperor of Japan. It is said that this sword has the power to break any curse. However, the sword is guarded by a powerful dragon, and Akira will have to brave great danger to obtain it.

Throughout her journey, Akira will face many challenges and make new friends and allies. But ultimately she must face her greatest foe: the sorcerer who cursed her. She must defeat him and break the curse, before it destroys her completely.
