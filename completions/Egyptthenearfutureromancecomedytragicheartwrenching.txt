In a future Egypt, a young woman named Aya falls in love with a man named Tariq. Despite the fact that they come from different social classes, the two are drawn to each other and begin a secret relationship.

However, their happiness is short-lived. Tariq is drafted into the army and sent to fight in a war against a neighboring country. Aya is left behind, heartbroken and alone.

While Tariq is away, Aya tries to busy herself with work and her hobbies, but she can't help but worry about him. She also finds herself increasingly drawn to a man named Khalil, a childhood friend who is now working as a journalist.

As the war drags on, Aya and Khalil grow closer. One day, they end up kissing. Aya feels guilty, but she can't help but be drawn to Khalil's passion and intensity.

Meanwhile, Tariq is fighting a losing battle. The conditions in the war zone are terrible, and morale is low. One day, in a moment of desperation, Tariq desertes his post. He is captured and brought back to Egypt as a prisoner of war.

Aya is overjoyed to see Tariq alive, but her happiness is short-lived. Tariq is now a traitor in the eyes of his country, and he is sent to prison. Aya visits him there, but their relationship is now strained. Tariq is bitter and angry, and he blames Aya for his current predicament.

Aya is torn. She still loves Tariq, but she can't help but be drawn to Khalil. Khalil is gentle and understanding, and he seems to genuinely care for her.

One day, Tariq escapes from prison. He goes to Aya, begging for her forgiveness. Aya is torn, but she ultimately decides to go with Khalil. Tariq is heartbroken, but he understands.

Aya and Khalil get married and move away. They start a new life together, and Aya finally finds happiness. However, she always wonders what could have been with Tariq.
