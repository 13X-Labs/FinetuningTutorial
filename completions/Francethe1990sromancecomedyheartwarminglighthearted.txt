When Francine (a young woman in her early twenties) moves to Paris from her small hometown in the south of France, she is determined to make a new life for herself. She quickly finds a job as a waitress in a charming café near the Eiffel Tower, and begins to settle into her new life.

However, Francine is quickly disillusioned by the harsh realities of city life; her boss is a demanding woman who is constantly criticising her, her roommates are cold and distant, and she can't seem to find any friends in her new city.

One day, Francine's luck begins to change when she meets Pierre (a dashing young man in his early thirties), who works in a nearby bookstore. Pierre is charming and handsome, and Francine quickly falls for him.

However, just as Francine is beginning to feel happy and settled in her new life, she discovers that Pierre is already in a relationship with another woman. Devastated, Francine turns to her friends and roommates for comfort, and finally begins to feel at home in her new city.

 Francine and Pierre eventually overcome their differences, and find themselves falling in love with each other. They must struggle to keep their relationship a secret from Pierre's girlfriend, while also trying to deal with the challenges of their own pasts.

Throughout it all, Francine and Pierre's relationship grows stronger and stronger, until they finally admit their love for each other. They get married in a small ceremony in the café where they first met, and live happily ever after.
