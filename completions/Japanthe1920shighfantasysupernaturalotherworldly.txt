A young woman, named Michi, lives in Japan during the 1920s. She is a medium and can see and communicate with ghosts. One day, she is contacted by the spirit of a woman named Juri, who was killed 100 years ago. Juri's spirit is seeking revenge against the man who killed her, and she asks Michi to help her.

Michi agrees to help Juri, and she uses her medium abilities to contact the spirit of the man who killed her. His name is Tatsuya, and he is also a medium. Michi tells Tatsuya that Juri's spirit is seeking revenge, and she offers to help mediate a resolution between the two of them.

Tatsuya is hesitant at first, but he eventually agrees to meet with Juri's spirit. During their meeting, Tatsuya confesses that he killed her because she was possessed by a demon. Juri's spirit is shocked and saddened by this revelation, but she forgives Tatsuya and moves on to the afterlife.

Michi helps Tatsuya to come to terms with what he has done, and the two of them become friends. They continue to work together as mediums, helping other spirits to move on to the afterlife.
