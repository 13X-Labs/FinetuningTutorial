In the near future, Italy is on the brink of a major financial collapse. The government is in disarray and the people are suffering. In the midst of all this, two young people, Gioia and Luca, fall in love.

Gioia is a young woman who comes from a wealthy family. She's gentle and kind, and she's been sheltered from the harsh realities of the world. Luca is a down-on-his-luck man who's trying to make a fresh start. He's rough around the edges, but he's got a good heart.

The two of them meet by chance and they quickly fall in love. They start to dream of a life together, but they quickly realize that their different backgrounds will make it difficult. They'll have to find a way to overcome the odds if they're going to make it work.

The story follows their struggle to stay together against all odds. They'll have to deal with Gioia's disapproving family, Luca's criminal past, and the mounting financial crisis that's threatening to tear their country apart.

It's a story of love, hope, and resilience in the face of adversity.
