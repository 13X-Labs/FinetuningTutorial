The film follows the story of two star-crossed lovers, Ahmed and Fatima, who are from opposite ends of the social spectrum in 1990s Egypt. Ahmed is a wealthy businessman from a prominent family, while Fatima is a poor girl from the slums. Despite their different backgrounds, the two have a chance meeting and instantly fall in love with each other.

However, their relationship is opposed by both of their families, who are intent on keeping them apart. Ahmed's family wants him to marry a woman from a similar background, while Fatima's family is worried that she will be taken advantage of if she pursues a relationship with Ahmed. Undeterred by their families' objections, the two lovers continue to see each other in secret.

As the relationship progresses, the two must deal with the challenges of their different upbringings. Ahmed is unused to the poverty and violence of Fatima's neighbourhood, while Fatima is unfamiliar with the wealthy lifestyle of Ahmed's family. Despite the difficulties, they persevere and their love for each other grows stronger.

The film culminates with a heartwarming happy ending, in which Ahmed and Fatima finally get married and live happily ever after, despite the odds.
