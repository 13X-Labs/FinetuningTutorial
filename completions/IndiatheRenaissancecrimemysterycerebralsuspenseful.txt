In the ancient city of India, a crime lord known as the Raja controls a dark empire of criminal activity. The Raja's henchmen are adept at assassination and he maintains a strict code of silence among his inner circle. Anyone who breaks the code is brutally killed.

The Raja's latest target is a young woman named Nala, who has uncovered evidence of his illegal activities. Nala is a skilled archer and she uses her skills to defend herself against the Raja's assassins.

With the help of her friend, a street-wise thief named Jai, Nala sets out to find the Raja and bring him to justice. The two allies must use all their skills to survive the perils of the city's dark underworld as they race against time to stop the Raja before he can silence them forever.
