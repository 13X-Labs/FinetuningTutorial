Olivier is a charming young man from a modest background. He's an aspiring writer who is trying to make it in the competitive Paris literary scene. The two of them begin a whirlwind romance, and Isabelle starts to think that she may have finally found her true soulmate.

However, Olivier is hiding a dark secret. He's already married to a woman named Simone, and their relationship is anything but happy. Simone is a cold, aristocratic woman who is more interested in status and money than she is in love.

As Olivier and Isabelle's relationship deepens, Simone becomes increasingly jealous. She starts to suspect that Olivier is cheating on her with Isabelle. She hires a private detective to follow him, and the detective discovers that Olivier and Isabelle are indeed having an affair.

Simone confronts Olivier and demands that he choose between her and Isabelle. Olivier chooses Isabelle, and Simone vows to destroy her. She starts spreading vicious rumors about Isabelle, trying to ruin her reputation.

In the end, Isabelle and Olivier are able to overcome all of the obstacles in their path and they find happiness together.
