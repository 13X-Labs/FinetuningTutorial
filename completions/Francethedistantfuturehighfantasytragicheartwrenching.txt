The film opens with a scene of a great battle. The forces of good are losing against the evil forces of the Darkness. As the battle seems lost, a lone hero appears. This hero is the last of a long line of great heroes, and he is the only one who can save the world from the Darkness.

He rallies the forces of good and leads them to victory against the Darkness. However, in the process, he is mortally wounded. As he lies dying, he gives his sword to the young hero who led the charge against the Darkness.

The film then jumps ahead many years. The young hero is now an old man. He has kept the sword all these years, and he knows that it is time to pass it on. He gives the sword to his son, who is also a great hero.

The son takes up the sword and leads the forces of good against the Darkness once again. This time, the Darkness is too strong and the son is killed. As he dies, he gives the sword to his own son.

And so it goes, for generation after generation, the heroes of the light fighting against the darkness, each passing down the sword to the next generation. Sometimes the light wins, and sometimes the darkness wins, but the cycle always continues.

Until one day, there is no one left to take up the sword. The world is plunged into darkness, and the forces of evil triumph. The film ends with the hero's sword being lost forever in the darkness.
