Libby, a young woman in her early twenties, is an aspiring writer who has just moved to New York City from her small hometown in upstate New York. She is fresh out of college and eager to start her career, but finds the competitive landscape of the publishing world to be daunting. She gets a job as a secretary at a small publishing house, which gives her a front-row seat to the inner workings of the business. She befriends one of the editors, James, who takes her under his wing and helps her navigate the cutthroat world of publishing.

One day, Libby is tasked with delivering some manuscripts to a famous author who lives in the city. When she arrives at his apartment, she is surprised to find that he is a recluse who never leaves his home. He is immediately intrigued by her and begins to shower her with attention. He introduces her to his work and the world of ideas, and she is soon swept up in his intellectually stimulating conversations. Romance begins to blossom between the two, but just as things are getting serious, the author suddenly dies.

Libby is heartbroken, but finds solace in her work. She throws herself into her job and is soon promoted to editor. James, who has always had feelings for her, begins to pursue her romantically. After a period of grieving, Libby realizes that she has feelings for James as well and the two begin a relationship. They get married and move to the suburbs, where they start a family.

The film ends with a montage of scenes from their life together, set to a nostalgic 60s pop song. We see them growing old together, raising their children and grandchildren, and still madly in love after all these years.
