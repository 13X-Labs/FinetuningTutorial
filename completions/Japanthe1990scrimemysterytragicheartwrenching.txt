In the late 1990s, Japan is haunted by a series of murders committed by a sadistic serial killer. The few clues left behind by the killer point to a possible connection to the yakuza, a powerful crime syndicate that controls much of the country's underground activity.

As the police struggle to solve the case, the killer strikes again, claiming another victim. This time, however, one of the victim's fingers is found at the crime scene, severed and wrapped in a piece of paper with a cryptic message written in blood.

The detectives assigned to the case realize that they are dealing with a deranged individual who is not afraid to kill again. They race against time to catch the killer before he can strike again.

The investigation leads the detectives to a small town in the mountains, where they discover that the killer has been targeting yakuza members. As they close in on the killer, they realize that he is driven by a twisted sense of revenge for the death of his family.

The final confrontation between the detectives and the killer is a tense standoff, during which the killer reveals the true extent of his depravity. In the end, the detectives catch the killer, but not before he takes one last victim.
