The film opens in the Indian city of Mumbai in the 1990s. We are introduced to our main character, a young woman named Aaliyah, who is struggling to make ends meet. She lives in a small apartment with her mother and sister, and works as a maid. One day, while Aaliyah is cleaning a wealthy man's home, she overhears a conversation between him and his wife that reveals they are planning to murder their daughter. Aaliyah is horrified and decides she must do something to stop them.

She goes to the police and tells them what she has overheard. The police investigate the couple and discover that they indeed were planning to murder their daughter. They arrest the couple and Aaliyah is hailed as a hero.

However, the couple's daughter is not grateful to Aaliyah for saving her life. In fact, she is angry and resentful. She believes that Aaliyah interfered where she wasn't wanted and ruined her parents' lives. The daughter grows up to be a successful lawyer, and when she has the chance to prosecute Aaliyah for a crime she didn't commit, she takes it.

Aaliyah is put on trial and found guilty. She is sentenced to life in prison, where she spends the rest of her days. Her story is one of tragedy, but also of hope; hope that even in the darkest of times, there is still the possibility of justice.
