At the height of apartheid, two young lovers are forced to part ways when the girl is shipped off to a forced marriage in another province. The boy, heartbroken and desperate, makes a rash decision to join the fight against apartheid. He quickly learns that the battle is much more complicated and brutal than he could have ever imagined, and that there are no easy answers. The girl, meanwhile, is trapped in a loveless marriage and yearns for her freedom. As the years go by, the boy and girl never forget each other, but it seems impossible that they will ever be able to find their way back to each other.

One day, out of the blue, the girl's husband dies, and she is finally free. She returns to her home town, and the first person she looks for is the boy she loved so long ago. But he is not the same boy she remembers. He has been hardened by years of fighting, and is now a leader in the resistance movement. She is not sure if he will be able to forgive her for what she did all those years ago.

But as they spend time together, rekindling their old flame, they realize that they still have a chance at happiness. But happiness is a luxury that they can ill-afford in a country that is still tearing itself apart.
