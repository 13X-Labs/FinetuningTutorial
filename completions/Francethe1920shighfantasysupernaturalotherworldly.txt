King Louis XXIV ruled over France with an iron fist. The people were starving and many had resorted to stealing just to survive. One day, a band of thieves managed to steal a priceless jewel from the king's castle. The king was furious and ordered his men to find the thieves and bring them to justice.

The thieves consisted of a skilled archer, a former soldier, and a young woman who had been forced into a life of crime to support her sick mother. They had planned to sell the jewel and use the money to start a new life elsewhere.

However, the king's men were hot on their trail. The archer was killed and the soldier was captured. The young woman managed to escape, but she was badly injured. She sought refuge in a nearby forest, where she collapsed from exhaustion.

She was found by a group of woodland creatures, who took her in and cared for her. They told her that the forest was a magical place and that she had been chosen to be its protector. The young woman embraced her new role and began to train with the creatures.

As she grew stronger, she began to develop magical powers. She used these powers to help the creatures of the forest and to protect it from the outside world.

One day, the king's men tracked her down. They had been sent to capture her and bring her back to the king. But the young woman was now a powerful sorceress and she fought back. She defeated the king's men and sent them running back to the castle.

The young woman had found her true calling. She was now the protector of the Forest and its creatures. She would defend them against anyone who tried to harm them.
