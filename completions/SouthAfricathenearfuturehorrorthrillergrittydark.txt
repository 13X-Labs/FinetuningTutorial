In a not-so-distant future, the world is on the brink of collapse. Natural resources are dwindling, wars are raging, and society is crumbling. In the midst of all this chaos, a new threat emerges: a virus that turns people into zombies.

The virus spread like wildfire, decimating populations and leaving entire cities in ruin. South Africa is one of the few places that has managed to avoid being overrun by the zombies, but it's only a matter of time before they breach the country's defenses.

As the situation grows more desperate, a group of survivors band together in an attempt to escape the coming zombie horde. They venture into the African wilderness, where they must battle not only the undead, but the harsh elements as well.

The group quickly realizes that they are not alone in the wilderness; there are others out there who are fighting for their lives. Some are friendly, while others are not. And as the group presses on, they realize that the real threat isn't the zombies... it's the living.
