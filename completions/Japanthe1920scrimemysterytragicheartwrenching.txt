It is the early 1920s in Japan. A young woman named Yukiko has just been widowed. She is now a single mother with a young son. Yukiko is struggling to make ends meet and is desperate to find a new husband. She meets a man named Jiro who is a widower himself. Jiro is a kind and gentle man and he and Yukiko soon fall in love. They get married and Yukiko moves into Jiro's house with her son.

All is well for a time, but then Yukiko's son goes missing. Yukiko is frantic with worry and searches for her son everywhere. Jiro is also searching for the boy, but to no avail. The police are called in and they begin a massive search for the missing child.

Days turn into weeks and there is still no sign of the boy. Yukiko is beside herself with grief and guilt. She blames herself for her son's disappearance and is sure that he is dead. Jiro is also grieving, but he remains supportive of Yukiko and tries to help her through her pain.

Then, one day, Yukiko's son is found. He has been hidden away in a small room in Jiro's house. Yukiko is overjoyed to be reunited with her son, but she is also devastated and angry that Jiro kept him hidden away from her. She can't understand why he would do such a thing.

Jiro explains that he was protecting Yukiko and her son. He knew that if the authorities found out about the boy, they would take him away from Yukiko and put him in an orphanage. Jiro couldn't bear the thought of that happening, so he hid the boy away.

Yukiko is torn. She is grateful to Jiro for saving her son, but she can't forgive him for the pain he has caused her. She decides to leave Jiro and take her son with her. She knows that it will be hard, but she is determined to start over and build a new life for herself and her son.
