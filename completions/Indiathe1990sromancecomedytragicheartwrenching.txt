Alisha and Raj were childhood sweethearts growing up in Delhi, India in the early 1990s. They were from very different backgrounds - Alisha was from a wealthy, upper-class family while Raj was from a modest, lower-class background - but they loved each other deeply and were completely inseparable.

Everything changed when Alisha's parents arranged for her to marry a wealthy man of their choosing. Alisha was heartbroken, but she didn't dare disobey her parents. Raj begged her to run away with him, but she refused, knowing that it would ruin her family's reputation. 

They parted ways, each going on to marry someone else. But they couldn't forget each other. Over the years, they kept in touch through letters and phone calls, sharing all the details of their lives - including their unhappy marriages.

 Finally, after years of yearning, they meet again. They realize that they're still madly in love with each other. They spend a passionate night together, but the next morning, Alisha's husband shows up and catches them in bed together.

Alisha is devastated. Her husband files for divorce and she is shunned by her family and society. Raj's wife does the same. They are both outcasts now, but they find solace in each other. Finally, they can be together.

But just as they're about to start their new life together, Alisha's husband shows up again. He's forgiven her and wants her back. Raj's wife does the same. They both have second thoughts about leaving their families, but they also can't deny their love for each other.

They say goodbye again, each knowing that it will be even harder this time. But they promise to never forget each other and the love they share.
