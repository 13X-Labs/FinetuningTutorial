In a future Japan that has been overrun by pollution and monsters, the only safe haven is the city of Akiba. The people of Akiba have built a wall around the city to keep the monsters out, and they live in fear of the day the wall will be breached.

One day, a group of adventurers arrives in Akiba, seeking to find a way to stop the monsters. They quickly realize that the only way to do this is to find the source of the pollution and destroy it. However, the source is deep in monster territory, and the only way to get there is through the city of Tokyo, which is now a giant maze of monster-infested ruins.

The heroes must brave the dangers of Tokyo in order to reach the source of the pollution and put an end to the monster problem. Along the way, they will face challenges and make allies, as they uncover the secrets of this new world.
