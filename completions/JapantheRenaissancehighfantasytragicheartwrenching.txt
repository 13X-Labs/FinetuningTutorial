A young woman named Miyuki is orphaned at a young age and taken in by a kind-hearted woman named Sachiko who runs a small inn in the countryside. Despite her difficult life, Miyuki is a bright and cheerful girl who dreams of becoming a samurai and one day serving her lord and protect her loved ones.

However, when Sachiko is unexpectedly killed by a band of samurai warriors who were attacking the inn, Miyuki's life is turned upside down. She is taken captive by the samurai and forced to serve them as a servant. For years, Miyuki endures abuse and hardship at the hands of her captors, but she never gives up hope of one day escaping and taking revenge against those who have wronged her.

Finally, after years of planning and waiting, Miyuki makes her move. She kills her captors and escapes, but not before her face is horribly disfigured in the process. Driven by revenge, Miyuki sets out to find and kill the leader of the samurai band who killed Sachiko.

But as she gets closer to her goal, Miyuki begins to realize that she can never fully escape her tragic past. And even if she does take revenge, will it be enough to bring her the peace she so desperately seeks?
