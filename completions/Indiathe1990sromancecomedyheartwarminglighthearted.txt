Rani is a 20-year-old Indian woman who lives in a small village in India with her parents. Rani is very shy and has never been in a relationship. Her best friend, Jai, is always trying to set her up on dates, but Rani is too scared to say yes. One day, Jai sets Rani up on a date with a man named Raj, who is a few years older than her. Rani is hesitant at first, but she decides to go on the date. 

Raj is a kind and handsome man, and Rani immediately feels comfortable with him. They go on a few more dates and eventually fall in love. Rani's parents are hesitant to approve of the relationship because Raj is from a different caste, but they eventually come around. Rani and Raj get married and have a happy life together.
