After the death of her mother, 21 year old Gabrielle is sent to live with her aunt in the south of France. Though initially resentful, Gabrielle soon falls in love with the country, its people, and its culture.

One day, Gabrielle meets a handsome stranger, Armand, who tells her about a secret kingdom hidden among the cliffs and caves of the region. Intrigued, Gabrielle sets out to find this kingdom, with Armand as her guide.

After a long journey, they reach the hidden kingdom, where they are warmly welcomed by the king and queen. Gabrielle is astonished to find that the kingdom is populated by fairies, elves, and other magical creatures.

Gabrielle quickly settles into life in the kingdom and becomes friends with many of its inhabitants. She even develops feelings for Armand, though she is not sure if he reciprocates.

One day, the kingdom is attacked by a band of humans, led by a woman who believes that the magical creatures are evil and must be destroyed. The creatures are able to fight back and defeat their attackers, but not before the woman takes Gabrielle hostage.

As the woman and her followers flee, Gabrielle is able to use her magic to escape. She returns to the kingdom and warn them of the woman's intentions.

Together, Gabrielle and the creatures of the kingdom devise a plan to stop the woman and her followers for good. They confront her and her army in a final battle and are victorious.

After the battle, Gabrielle decides to stay in the kingdom and becomes its queen. She and Armand live happily ever after.
