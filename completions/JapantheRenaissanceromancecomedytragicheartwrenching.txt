during the renaissance in Japan, a young woman named Sadako is arranged to marry a wealthy man named Kenshin. Though she is reluctant at first, she soon falls in love with him and they have a beautiful wedding. However, tragedy strikes when Kenshin is killed in battle just a few months later. Devastated, Sadako is left a widow at only eighteen.

Though her family tries to comfort her, Sadako is inconsolable and withdraws from everyone. One day, she sees a handsome young man named Akira walking by and is immediately drawn to him. Akira is a kind and gentle soul, and he quickly falls in love with Sadako.

Despite the objections of her family, the two get married. They are happy for a time, but Sadako is still haunted by the loss of her first husband. One day, she sees a man who looks just like Kenshin and follows him, only to discover that it is his identical twin brother, Tatsuya.

Tatsuya is a bitter man, who has always resented his brother for being the favored one. He can see how much Sadako still loves Kenshin, and he is determined to make her his own. He begins to woo her, and though she resists at first, she eventually succumbs to his charms.

Just as Tatsuya is about to win Sadako's heart, Kenshin's ghost appears to her and begs her to remember their love. This wakes her up from her trance, and she realizes that she can never love Tatsuya the way she loved Kenshin.

She breaks off their relationship, leaving Tatsuya heartbroken. Sadako remains a loyal wife to Akira, and the two of them live happily ever after.
