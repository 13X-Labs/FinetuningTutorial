In a future England that is strangely reminiscent of the Victorian era, young Penelope (or “Penny”) is of age to be married off. Her mother is eager to see her settled into a good match, but Penny is not interested in any of the suitors her mother has lined up for her. One night, while Penny is sneaking out of the house to meet her best friend Peggy for a night on the town, she is caught by her mother’s butler, Wilton. Wilton has been secretly in love with Penny for years, and he sees this as his opportunity to finally tell her how he feels.

Wilton confesses his love to Penny, and although she is initially shocked, she cannot help but be touched by his sincerity. They agree to keep their relationship a secret from Penny’s mother, who would surely disapprove. Over the next few weeks, Penny and Wilton meet in secret and fall madly in love with each other.

One night, as they are preparing to meet for their usual rendezvous, Wilton is intercepted by Penny’s mother and her henchman, Mr. Potts. They have found out about the relationship and demand that Wilton end it immediately or face dire consequences. Wilton refuses, and Penny’s mother orders Mr. Potts to “take care of him.”

Mr. Potts beats Wilton within an inch of his life and leaves him for dead. When Wilton comes to, he is hysterical with worry for Penny’s safety. He manages to drag himself to Peggy’s house, where Penny is staying, and collapses at her feet.

Penny is frantic with worry for Wilton, and she tends to his wounds as best she can. Her mother soon finds out about their relationship and is furious, but Penny refuses to give him up. She declares her love for Wilton and says she will run away with him if necessary.

Penny’s mother disowns her and Wilton is forced to leave his job, but they are content to be together. They move into a small cottage and live happily ever after.
