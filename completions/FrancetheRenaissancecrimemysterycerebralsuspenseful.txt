In Renaissance France, a group of courtiers and nobles plots to steal the throne from the ailing King Charles IX. They enlist the help of a rogue physician, who agrees to help them poison the king. The physician is able to slip the poison into the king's food, and the king soon dies.

With the king dead, the conspirators move to take control of the government. They appoint one of their own as the new king, and begin to consolidate power. But soon, they realize that they are not the only ones with a claim to the throne.

There is another group of nobles who also have a valid claim to the throne, and who are not about to give up without a fight. The two sides clash in a series of bloody battles, as each tries to wrest control of the government.

In the end, the conspirators are successful in taking control of the government. But the price is high, as the country is left in a state of chaos.
