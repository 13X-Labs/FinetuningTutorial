In the late 1990s, in the bustling metropolis of Beijing, two young people meet and fall in love. Despite their different backgrounds - he's a rich, spoiled playboy, while she's a poor, working-class girl - they're drawn to each other and can't deny their feelings.

However, their relationship is not without its challenges. He comes from a traditional, wealthy family who believe that marriage should be a business arrangement, while she is determined to pursue her own dreams. Additionally, they must contend with the disapproval of their families, friends, and society at large.

Nonetheless, they find a way to be together, and their love deepens. However, tragedy strikes when, just as they're about to get married, he is killed in a car accident. Devastated, she is left to pick up the pieces and tries to move on with her life.

But even though he's gone, he's still very much present in her heart. And, as she comes to realize, their love was truly meant to be. Even though they're apart, he will always be with her.
